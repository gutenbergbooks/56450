<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2></div>


<p>In offering the &#8220;Pleiades Club&#8221; to the public, I have no
apologies to make. Some may object to the declarations
contained herein, but they are all consistent with intelligent
beliefs, and not contrary to fixed or orthodox faith. &#8220;There
is no death,&#8221; and my thought is to strengthen and impress
this health-giving idea upon all of my readers. I have
undertaken to describe a reign of harmony that exists after
&#8220;Life&#8217;s fitful fever&#8221; which is more worthy of credence than
the hell afire and damnation espoused by some creeds and
religions; and I hope that my telegraph friends will feel
better on this score from a perusal of the &#8220;Pleiades Club.&#8221;</p>

ON THE PLANET MARS</h2></div>


<h3><i>Eternity Illustrated.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">ETERNITY is an awe-inspiring theme and one which
our little finite minds are unable to comprehend. It
is a subject, however, which should never worry or
distress us, when we stop to realize that we are all
living in the eternal now.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, an evangelist, in following up his
line of business, rendered a discourse on &#8220;Eternity&#8221; which
would have given one an opportunity for endless mathematics.</p>

<p>&#8220;Supposing this earth was a huge ball of steel,&#8221; he
began, &#8220;25,000 miles in circumference and a little bird
would pass over it once every thousand years, lightly
touching this immense steel body with the tip of its wing.
Were you to tell the souls in hades that they would be
released by the time the bird had cut a hole through and
divided the sphere, there would be great rejoicing among
the condemned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Knowing that there is nothing lost in God&#8217;s creation this
little allegory should never make one nervous, for we also
know that, like John Brown, our &#8220;soul goes marching on,&#8221;
onward and upward.</p>

<p>Having delivered my text, I will proceed with my story.</p>


<h3><i>Lincoln&#8217;s Birthday on Planet Mars.</i></h3>

<p>It was a delightful gathering which assembled at a
dinner on the planet Mars given in honor of Abraham
Lincoln, on the occasion of his birthday, by the Pleiades
Club, composed mostly of old-time telegraph men and
their admirers, A. D. 1916.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Numerically, the gathering was greater than that which
assembled on any previous occasion on Mother Earth, and
viewing the happy, smiling faces of those present, one felt
that it was good to be here.</p>

<p>Sounders clicked on every side; all were readable, and
harmony prevailed, nobody ever sending six dots for the
letter &#8220;p&#8221; or the figure 4 for a &#8220;v.&#8221;</p>

<p>President Lincoln presided and much attention was paid
to his remarks. The President&#8217;s face possessed that
wonderfully kind and loving appearance so apparent during
life and his voice bespoke his gentle spirit. Earnestly he
chatted with some late arrivals on Mars, asking particularly
for his old telegraph associates on earth. He enquired
about the &#8220;Sacred three&#8221; and Billy Dealy and many of
the boys in the field in the stirring days of the war.</p>

<p>The President was a busy soul, looking out for &#8220;his
Father&#8217;s business,&#8221; as he expressed it, and he was the
recipient of much reverence from all assembled.</p>


<h3><i>Aaron Hilliker Sings Olden Song.</i></h3>

<p>Music was called for, when to the astonishment of all,
the form of A. B. Hilliker appeared at the threshold.
Aaron was as full of bonhomme as of yore and responded
to many requests by singing &#8220;The Old Oaken Bucket,&#8221;
which evoked an enthusiastic encore.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you sine in the spring of &#8217;73?&#8221; queried Jim
Largay.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have asked me what I sined in &#8217;53,&#8221; replied
Hilliker, as he smiled at Professor Morse, who pleasantly
returned the recognition.</p>

<p>&#8220;The question before the Club tonight is &#8216;Preparedness,&#8217;&#8221;
remarked General Thomas T. Eckert, &#8220;and I would like to
see this subject fully discussed,&#8221; continued that gallant
gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Biff Cook Makes a Speech.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; interposed &#8220;Biff&#8221; Cook, &#8220;that is all
provided for and should our beloved country ever get into
a war, it will be one of short duration. It will be a one
man&#8217;s war against a congress of nations. Why, my friends,
the &#8216;Wizard of Menlo Park&#8217; has all that studied out, but
he is not talking about it or giving the idea away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; continued Cook, emphasizing his words, &#8220;Tom
Edison has it all figured out that in twelve hours&#8217; time he
can weave a cobweb of wires on our ocean&#8217;s shore to
completely annihilate immediately any threatening craft
fifty miles out at sea. I wish that I could communicate
this information to the timid people down there on earth,
for I believe it would do them a world of good.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know all about this, for Tom told me about the
scheme back there in &#8217;74, when I used to &#8216;dot on his
quadruplex&#8217; along with Eddie Fullum and Billy Landy, at
145 Broadway.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, boys,&#8221; went on &#8220;Biff,&#8221; &#8220;let&#8217;s talk of the wireless.
We are all so much interested in that. Why, it was only
last week that we all heard New York talking to Honolulu
and I tried to break in, but that &#8216;ham&#8217; in New York would
not adjust and we lost our opportunity of being heard.
Just think, if he had pulled up his relay just half an inch
we would have been in direct communication. If that
fellow had ever worked in Cheyenne alongside of Comb
Green, when I worked the overland at Omaha, he would
have known something about keeping adjusted and the
dear old Earth would have received startling news which
would have thrown the feat of Commander Peary into
the shade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know, cull,&#8221; continued Cook, &#8220;that I really
believe that our planet Mars may be called upon to perform
her good offices in case any hostile nation should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
attempt to invade the United States, and I believe that
Tom Edison has solved that intricate problem.&#8221;</p>

<p>With these remarks, &#8220;Biff&#8221; sat down amid thundering
applause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The St. Louis band, composed of W. W. Cummings,
Sidney B. Fairchild, James Nelson and James Murray,
then rendered &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner,&#8221; after which
the audience was addressed on the subject of wireless
telegraph.</p>

<p>Professor Zingalli, of Milan, whose name would indicate
that he was &#8220;flagging&#8221; while on earth, gave the assemblage
a graphic account of the possibilities of the wireless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my friends,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this science is still in its
infancy. Were I to tell you of all its possibilities, you
would not believe me. The day is sure to come when all
you gentlemen will have an opportunity of talking to your
loved ones on earth by means of the wireless telephone.
There will be a million circuits running into Chicago, none
of them interfering with the other. Every hamlet in the
country will have a wireless telephone and telegraph instrument.
Trains will be run by wireless, ships will use
wireless as a motive power and city car lines&#8217; power will
be usurped by the ever present wireless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I would not have to walk any more from San
Francisco to Chicago, would I?&#8221; ejaculated the irrepressible
&#8220;Bogy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cold day when you ever walked,&#8221; laughed Hank
Cowan, who sat opposite his former colleague. &#8220;That
&#8216;con&#8217; told me a different story; yes, you walked all the
way, of course you did, but only from one end of the car
to the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>This sally caused much merriment among the members
of the Club, which gave way to a speech entitled &#8220;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Future of the Telegraph,&#8221; specially prepared for the occasion
by Col. Mark D. Crain.</p>

<p>The meeting then adjourned subject to the call of the
secretary, who was none else than that prince of good
fellows, Jim P. Doody.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER II.</small><br />

FOURTH OF JULY ON PLANET MARS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was much commotion on the planet Mars.</p>

<p>As closely as the most patriotic mathematician
could reckon time and compare it with a corresponding
period on the Earth, it was Fourth of
July and the dwellers on Mars decided to celebrate in a
&#8220;sane&#8221; manner.</p>

<p>Everybody to their own liking and the American members
of the Pleiades Club determined that this should be
the occasion when Colonel Marquis Delafayette Crain
should address them on &#8220;The Future of the Telegraph.&#8221;</p>

<p>The club members began gathering at an early hour,
forming into little knots in a semi-circle around the speaker&#8217;s
stand. It was a &#8220;get acquainted&#8221; meeting, too, and
the committee of arrangements was kept very busy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have known Bert Ayres for many years and
copied press from him many a night,&#8221; said O. A. Gurley,
as Mr. Ayres was introduced. Merry sallies passed between
the two gentlemen, when the gavel sounded with a
loud rap and the master of ceremonies introduced Col.
Mark D. Crain, the speaker.</p>

<p>Loud and enthusiastic greetings followed this introduction
and the Colonel smilingly acknowledged the welcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Colonel Crain Delivers Address.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;I am to speak today upon the future of the telegraph,&#8221;
he began, but he was interrupted by Ed. Parmalee, who
asked him to change his topic to the &#8220;past&#8221; history of
the telegraph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot do it just now, as I am all primed with my
topic, and some other time will do; besides, you know,
we are now in Eternity and we have all the time there is.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colonel then took up his manuscript, which he
began to read:</p>

<p>&#8220;The telegraph has made astounding progress during
the past five years,&#8221; he began, &#8220;but there are much better
things in store for the employes than ever before.</p>

<p>&#8220;For instance, a device has been invented which practically
annihilates time when it comes to taking messages
off the wires.</p>

<p>&#8220;A typewriter with the standard keyboard is used, but
the combinations are numerous. To an expert, ten words
are written with one touch of the key and a fifty-word
night letter will be written by simply touching five different
keys on the typewriter. It all depends upon knowing
how, and you know,&#8221; remarked the Colonel merrily,
&#8220;we get paid for what we know, and not for what we do.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can now see that it will take but ten seconds to
receive a fifty-word night letter, but the toll to the public
is just the same. The companies, however, are willing to
divide the earnings with the operators and a new schedule
of salaries has been made as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Operators will receive ten mills for each message
handled, but they are required to handle at least 500
messages every hour, their work being confined to five
hours a day.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see their wages will therefore be $5 per hour, or
$25 per day for five hours&#8217; work. The company will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
permit an operator to work more than twenty days a
month, so the maximum salary for each operator will
be $500.</p>

<p>&#8220;The company will furnish three meals a day&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I understand you to say &#8216;free meals a day?&#8217;&#8221; broke
in Jake Tubman, who sat near the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have said three free meals a day,&#8221; laughingly
replied the speaker, and, continuing, &#8220;and automobiles will
call for and return each employe home.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chief will meet each operator at the door when
he quits for the day and ask him the state of his health,
how he enjoyed his work, and if he has any grievance to
relate. The manager, too, will greet operators all at the
landing of the elevator and ask them if they care to &#8216;draw&#8217;
today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my, that strikes me about right,&#8221; cried out Fred
Loomis, and many others showed their appreciation of
the innovation.</p>

<p>&#8220;All operators will be treated with much consideration
and distinction, especial attention being given to pacifying
all recalcitrants and smoothing out all kicks and complaints
which may arise, but it is thought the programme
outlined will wipe out all differences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Crain&#8217;s speech was followed with wild applause
and a big demonstration. The band played &#8220;Happy Days&#8221;
on the harps.</p>

<p>After order had been restored, Colonel Crain was asked
to speak on the &#8220;old timers,&#8221; it being remarked that he
should be quite at home on that topic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know a few of them,&#8221; began Mark. &#8220;They came
and went when I was in Kansas City, and we always had
a delightful time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see, there was Jim Delong&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Present,&#8221; interrupted the voice of Mr. Delong, amid
applause.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>The speaker continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there was Billy Spink, too&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here also,&#8221; broke in the familiar voice of Mr. Spink,
who received an encore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there was Frank Farley, Dan Martin, Billy Foy,
Jim Cook, Milton Geowey, Harry Smith, John Topliff&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget me,&#8221; broke in Fred Swain, as he swung
into sight on the arm of Bob Rankin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to overlook you,&#8221; continued Crain; &#8220;I
remember the time you wanted to take a trip with me
from the window of the tenth floor of the Chicago office,
without an aeroplane.&#8221;</p>

<p>This remark evoked much merriment among the old
timers of Chicago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to meet and
greet you all here today and to realize that we do not have
to put a sub. on and that all the wires are always working
O. K.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is because you have the pick of the construction
department,&#8221; smilingly remarked M. C. Bristol, and the
assemblage acquiesced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get back to the original text,&#8221; said Billy West,
who had been deeply interested in Mr. Crain&#8217;s address.
&#8220;I would like to hear more of the future of the telegraph
and I greatly enjoy hearing Colonel Crain&#8217;s remarks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, here are a few pages that the Colonel overlooked,&#8221;
said secretary Jim Doody, handing the same to
Mr. Crain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I have something else to say and a little story
to relate which, I think, you will all be pleased to listen to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence once more reigned as the speaker began:</p>

<p>&#8220;The telegraph stock is away up, Western Union selling
for $495 and Postal $415. The companies are studying
the advisability of segregating a portion of their stock for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
charitable purposes, which idea is under consideration by
the executive committee.</p>

<p>&#8220;An operator will be retired when he has reached the
age of thirty with a pension of five years&#8217; salary in advance
to enable him to go into some profitable business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I am not on Earth to witness such dreadful
extravagances,&#8221; interrupted Russell Sage, who had been
an attentive listener.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are my sentiments also,&#8221; cried Jay Gould, who
had arrived in time to hear the last part of Colonel Crain&#8217;s
address.</p>

<p>&#8220;My remarks will close with a little story about one of
our most distinguished members. The story may not be
a new one to you who are here present, but it is a good
one,&#8221; and Colonel Crain paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, go ahead,&#8221; shouted the audience; &#8220;let&#8217;s have the
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was about a quarter of a century ago on the planet
Mars and a great commotion was going on at the gates.
There had been an unusual exodus from Earth, the accommodation
train bringing with it many millionaires, all
ready to become citizens.</p>

<p>&#8220;One man hurriedly left the train and began elbowing
his way through the surging crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Addressing the doorkeeper, the newcomer asked to be
admitted instantly, but was told that he must take his turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indignation filled the newly arrived, who exclaimed,
&#8216;My name is Jay Gould and while on earth I could buy my
way in at any place. I did not bring any money with me,
but I can give you a check for any amount you say. I want
to get in quickly, so just say how much money you want.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The doorkeeper paused for a moment and replied: &#8216;A
million up here counts for one cent and a second of time
is the same as a thousand years.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>&#8220;&#8216;All right,&#8217; exclaimed Gould, &#8216;just tell me how much
money you want to let me in.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again did the doorkeeper stop to think, finally ejaculating,
&#8216;One hundred millions.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Here is a check for it,&#8217; said Gould.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wait a minute,&#8217; replied the doorkeeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;This conversation occurred about twenty-five years ago
and it is evident that Mr. Gould did not &#8216;wait a minute&#8217;
as suggested by the doorkeeper.&#8221;</p>

<p>This story was received with a tumult of applause by
the entire assemblage, after which the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>It was understood that the next meeting would be addressed
by a number of southern operators, who will relate
their telegraphic experience while on Earth.</p>

DIXIE DAY ON PLANET MARS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT WAS certainly a choice gathering of spirits who flocked
together at Telegraphers&#8217; Tabernacle to listen to the
doings of the boys from Dixie who were members of
this honorable body.</p>

<p>Fred B. Moxon, courtly and affable as of old, called
the meeting to order.</p>

<p>Mr. Moxon explained that the meeting was called for
the purpose of having a pleasant time and everyone was
cordially invited to say something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Bob Irwin, &#8216;Canada&#8217;s fastest man,&#8217; present?&#8221; came
an inquiry from Dave Ryan.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Bob and Aleck Sinnot went a-fishing this morning
down to Hesperian canal, but we expect to see them back
very soon.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>&#8220;I say, Dave,&#8221; queried Kentucky George Ellsworth,
&#8220;how about that story that Brother Topping tells about
you when you were on General Bragg&#8217;s staff? Did the
General really cease hostilities on a certain occasion till
you could be located?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just you read United States history and get better
acquainted with me,&#8221; testily replied Ryan. But a smile
speedily lit up the old war horse&#8217;s face when he recognized
the president of the meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if there isn&#8217;t Fred Moxon, whom I left in St.
Louis in 1875. Glad to see you, old boy; do you remember
how you used to paste me when I was down there in
Galveston? I tell you what, to take you and fight those
native mosquitoes was a bigger job than fighting under
General Bragg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Dave, you remember how that old Long Horn
wire used to work and how those repeaters at Denison
would rattle? The man in charge of the Denison repeaters
went to sleep one night and I could not hear you break.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never broke in my life,&#8221; interrupted Ryan.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, too,&#8221; agreed Moxon, &#8220;and the only way I
knew you were getting me was to ask New Orleans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same old stunt,&#8221; broke in Cy Whitaker, who just arrived
and took a seat in front.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, here is Ed Whitford, is he in our class?&#8221; asked
&#8220;Fid&#8221; Powers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he is eligible, for he worked two winters in New
Orleans. Let him sit down, as I have one on him,&#8221; suggested
Dick Babbitt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Ed, you are welcome at our festive board.
I want to tell the boys of the joke you played on me once
upon a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dropped into the Chicago office to get acquainted
with the boys and see what new things had been introduced.
Whitford was always the master of ceremonies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the Chicago office, doubtless because he could always see
a funny side to everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Look at this big ground wire,&#8217; said Whitford, pointing
to the iron pillar, which ran from floor to ceiling, the only
obstruction in the big room. &#8216;Yes, this is the ground wire
which grounds every wire in Chicago and ofttimes holds
millions of volts. There is enough electricity in the ground
wire at this minute to completely annihilate an entire army
if applied in the proper way; yes, this ground wire is one
of the institutions of Chicago.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Want to see some good receiving? Well, come here
and witness the finest operator in the world. He can copy
100 words behind, as I will show you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Going up to Jack Carroll, who was receiving a special
from Luke Fisher, at Omaha, Whitford grabbed Carroll&#8217;s
hand, which he shook for two minutes, Fisher sending at
top notch speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Releasing his hand, Carroll took up a new sheet and
began to copy just as if he had not been interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wonderful, wonderful,&#8217; ejaculated the spectators, but
we did not know that Jack had a time in squaring himself
with Luke Fisher to get him to repeat the missing portion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Ed, you were always on hand like warts when it
came to going to the annual reunion of the Old Timers,
too,&#8221; said Billy West, who arrived at this juncture, high
hat and gold-headed cane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you again, Bill,&#8221; shouted many voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, let us quit shop talk for a few minutes and
see what the latest is from the seat of the great European
battle ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Mr. Chairman, can you tell me if Ethiopia has
joined the allies,&#8221; questioned Jim Taylor, a recently arrived
colored employe from Minneapolis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you bet; I could make out a battalion marching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
north and they were carrying the national flag of Ethiopia,&#8221;
remarked Charlie Newton, as he sauntered in.</p>

<p>&#8220;What am the flag of Ethiopia?&#8221; asked Taylor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it is a picture of a watermelon cut in halves on
one side of the flag and a ham bone on the other side,&#8221;
laughingly replied Newton, and a burst of merriment
ensued.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been practicing with mirrors,&#8221; began Moxon,
&#8220;and I find that I can bottle up and concentrate enough of
the sun&#8217;s rays to completely vaporize any intruding battleship
100 miles at sea. We turn on our searchlight, which
is equal to a billion candle power and signal for her to
turn back. Upon her refusal to do so, the bottled up
energy of the sun is turned on and presently a smoke arises
which in five minutes is lifted and nothing can be seen of
the unfriendly man o&#8217; war.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in telepathic communication with my old partner,
Jeff Hayes, who is still a resident of the terrestrial sphere,
and we are able to convey much intelligence in this way
to each other. I have already given him the dope on this
new idea and you will find that the matter will be given
the widest publicity on earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I notice we have with us Col. Tally Mann, once of
Sherman, Jack Taylor of Galveston, Ed Davis, David
Flannery, Charlie Patch, Jim Stacey, Jack McDonald,
Jimmie Rust, Jack Sinclair, Jack Graham and Phil Fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the mention of each name a cheer went up, each
gentleman arising and making a graceful bow.</p>

<p>Bob Irwin, &#8220;Canada&#8217;s fastest,&#8221; put in an appearance
now with a string of Dollie Varden trout which he stated
he had caught over in the Hesperian canal.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I did not subsidize any small boy, either,&#8221; warmly
remarked Irwin, &#8220;for I am a fisherman from way back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you used to catch catfish on the Mississippi below
St. Louis,&#8221; said John Topliff as he bobbed to the front.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>&#8220;I never contradict my chief operator; you taught me
that stunt,&#8221; retorted Irwin, and all the St. Louis contingent
laughed to the echo.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never liked that story Dick Babbitt propagated about
David Flannery. You remember that one about &#8216;Jobs and
Positions.&#8217; I never liked it and I am going to tell Dick so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I plead guilty,&#8221; said Babbitt, adding &#8220;and I throw myself
upon the mercy of the Court.&#8221; This remark was
made with mock solemnity, which evoked an &#8220;Aw, forgit
it&#8221; from Davis.</p>

<p>The band, of which Ed Leloup was the leader, discoursed
some stirring Southern melodies, after which the meeting
took the form of a general social feast, many introductions
being made.</p>

<p>There was no bickering, no quarreling, no riotousness on
the planet Mars. Surely everyone was supposed to forget
all these ere they could remain in peace in this delightful
haven of rest.</p>

<p>Everything was so harmonious here that few cared to
leave its delightful precincts until lapse of time urged him
for a higher climb.</p>

<p>To the lover of music, music was everywhere; to the
student of literature, the universe was an open book, always
ready to instruct an earnest student; to the inquirer
after the arts and sciences, Mars gives ample opportunity
for study and advancement, but to the person who makes
inquiry after the pleasures of a flesh, a big and emphatic
&#8220;No&#8221; is given. Mars and its inhabitants are built on different
lines.</p>

<p>Pardon being asked for and granted for this diversion,
Chairman Moxon announced that the next meeting would
be held under the auspices of the old Chicago office, which
announcement created a whirlwind of applause.</p>

<p>Lara Boone and Hank Spencer then sang, &#8220;Oh Where
Is My Wandering Boy Tonight&#8221; and the meeting passed
into history.</p>

CHICAGO TAKES A HAND</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT WAS Chicago day on the planet Mars and from every
quarter of our nearest starry neighbor came flitting the
individuals who at one time or another worked in the
Chicago telegraph offices.</p>

<p>It did not matter what company was the employer, railroad
or telegraph; all were as welcome as the flowers in
May and all felt at home.</p>

<p>There were many familiar faces and it will be our privilege
to mention many of the dear denizens of this happy
stopping place, where all is peace and harmony and where
our telegraph and railroad friends obtain their first taste
of heavenly happiness.</p>

<p>Al Baker presided over the meeting and announced that
James E. Pettit would be temporary secretary for the
Society of the United States Military Telegraph Corps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not make John Brant secretary for the Old
Timers&#8217; association also; it would look so much like olden
times,&#8221; said Col. John J. Dickey, and the suggestion
evoked much applause and presently both gentlemen were
at their desks wielding their pens just as they used to do
on earth.</p>


<h3><i>Al Baker&#8217;s Speech.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;They used to call me the &#8216;old preacher&#8217; when I was
night chief operator of the Chicago office,&#8221; began the
president, Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>He was interrupted by Fred Swain, who remarked that
they had often heard A. B. Cowan relate incidents showing
his tendency toward Biblical lore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have heard the story,&#8221; replied Baker. &#8220;It occurred
on the occasion of a big storm in Chicago, but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
are here today to talk &#8216;shop&#8217; and I hope we will hear from
many of our friends present, for we can tell something
interesting, each one of us.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a few preliminary remarks to make and I hope
our beloved secretary, Mr. Brant, will report me as correctly
as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to convey to the telegraph people on old Mother
Earth that it is a psychological fact that if they would only
make their profession a life-long business, similar to that
of a doctor, dentist, lawyer or minister, their condition
while on earth would vastly improve. They should take
advantage of all the education obtainable in their line,
through reading and studying text books on electrical
matters and endeavor to qualify themselves for higher
positions which are bound to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not be long ere the prevailing company will
build into Mexico, and, in fact, cover South America. Those
fellows down there need somebody to show them how to
telegraph and I guess there would be a great number of
good tutors in New York, Chicago and St. Louis, and just
fancy the revenue that would be derived.</p>

<p>&#8220;The opening of this southern country would give every
ambitious and capable man in the service an opportunity
of shining as a superintendent or in some other official
capacity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember, boys, how they used to sing after the
war of the rebellion a ditty about &#8216;Uncle Sam is rich
enough to buy us all a farm.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the telegraph company is rich enough to make
all capable men a superintendent in South America.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you understand, boys,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that
the subject we are discussing will not interest us personally,
for we are all now &#8216;about our Father&#8217;s business,&#8217; but
it is a happy thought to know that our loved ones on
earth are going to be provided for.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>Mr. Baker&#8217;s remarks were greeted with much delighted
applause and Secretary Brant stated that he had made a
stenographic copy of the same, which he would hand to
Fred Moxon, who in turn would transmit it by telepathy
to his friend on the terrestrial planet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will now listen to the Chicago Glee Club,&#8221; remarked
President Baker, and vociferous cheers went up
as the forms of Sam Bracken, Al Babb, Jim Delong and
Harry Smith appeared, each bearing a harp of a thousand
strings.</p>

<p>Some of these gentlemen could not warble a note while
on earth, but were now students of music and harmony,
and well did they acquit themselves, even indulging their
audience in a little rag time.</p>

<p>Al Babb was particularly happy in his illustrative Indian
war dances, scalp dances and the like.</p>

<p>Applications for membership into the Chicago branch
of the Pleiades Club brought out many hundreds of new
and old faces, and as time was no object to them it was
decided to hold this as a continuous meeting until everyone
was ready to acquiesce in adjournment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys, I am interested to visit the next &#8216;mile-post&#8217; in
our eternal flight,&#8221; remarked &#8220;Dad&#8221; Armstrong as he
came on the platform to shake hands with President Baker.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like to go up to Jupiter for a month or so,&#8221;
continued Armstrong, but he was interrupted by Ed Whitford,
who exclaimed, &#8220;Better go a little slow, Dad; you
know if you climb upwards you cannot come back, for it
is just like the butterfly and caterpillar. You have to keep
a-going if you start,&#8221; and here Whitford paused and presently
sang that good old hymn, &#8220;I&#8217;m a pilgrim, I can tarry
but a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Armstrong, to the delight of the club, concluded to tarry
a while longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I notice we have Henry C. Maynard with us today,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
said the president. &#8220;Will he kindly step to the front?&#8221;
Cheers rent the air as Mr. Maynard&#8217;s familiar figure
mounted to the platform.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Brother Maynard, do you remember the night
you told me, along about eleven o&#8217;clock, that you could
now dispense &#8216;without&#8217; my services?&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker was Billy Wallace, and his remark occasioned
much merriment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I remember very well,&#8221; returned Mr. Maynard,
&#8220;but you know that I did not care so much for the
queen&#8217;s English as I did to see the &#8216;C U B&#8217; was promptly
handled on the overland.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad to see this happy throng,&#8221; continued
Mr. Maynard, &#8220;and I am perfectly willing to have &#8216;Chicago
day&#8217; last for an entire year, for I believe there would not
be one dull moment during this period.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will have occasion to address you quite often during
the meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me, please, who it was that got &#8216;and a
city&#8217; for &#8216;audacity&#8217;?&#8221; questioned J. DeWitt Congdon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the &#8216;guilty&#8217; man, for I got that the same night
that the young fellow in Galveston reported that Tom
Brown, a negro, was found &#8216;quilty&#8217; of murder,&#8221; exclaimed
Charley Hazelton, who sat near &#8220;c g.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will be glad to hear from Pete Rowe and listen to
some of his wild and woolly experiences in Elko, Nev.,&#8221;
said the president, &#8220;but we will hearken first to a song by
Les Bradley, who will favor us with &#8216;Pat Clancey&#8217;s
Shovel.&#8217;&#8221; The song was rendered in the most inimitable
style by Bradley.</p>

PETER ROWE&#8217;S PROHIBITION SPEECH</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE AUDIENCE at the meeting of the telegraph
people assembled in session at the Pleiades Club
on the planet Mars to listen to remarks from
Peter A. Rowe and others, were quite on the <i>qui
vive</i> in anticipation of something out of the ordinary and
they were certainly well rewarded for their patient waiting.</p>

<p>Mr. Al Baker, who was presiding, introduced the
speaker of the day, for &#8220;there is no night&#8221; on the planet
Mars, and Mr. Rowe was well received.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been asked to relate my experience out in the
West, but I think that I would prefer to say something
upon a subject nearer my heart,&#8221; Mr. Rowe began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did go it some while on earth and were I inclined
to be remorseful, I would be very unhappy indeed, but
up here in the second heaven we have all learned that
remorse is as much to be dreaded as is hate, malice, envy,
revenge and a hundred more kindred vices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every sin is forgiven as we turn from it and now I
have nothing to regret for any shortcomings that I may
have had while on Earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;To get back to my topic. I notice on the bulletin board
that there is a connection between this mile post on our
heavenly flight and my former friends on Earth and I
would like to have your secretary quote my remarks for
the benefit of those who are still tempted in the manner I
was, while on Earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am rejoiced to know that the South has gone dry,
and I am thankful, too, that the West is following in the
same line, and were I again a legislator from Cook County,
Ill., I would preach from the house-top and from the hill-top,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the great good of national prohibition and I would
not cease a moment till I made Chicago a &#8216;dry&#8217; city. I
feel that I would have the hearty thanks of the telegraph
and railroad companies and also of all the telegraph
employes once the bill became a law and all were inured
to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our people on Mars are true blue and there is no
insincerity to be found in our ranks. We have all been
purged of that and we all feel the better for it.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Rowe continued in his happy vein to relate his
experiences while he was manager at Elko, Nev., when
that office was a repeating point, his remarks evoking
many merry rounds of applause.</p>

<p>He was very much in earnest in his statements on
prohibition and his listeners were greatly interested, Mr.
Fred Moxon taking the notes down in shorthand for the
benefit of his earthly friends.</p>

<p>The band played, &#8220;Father, dear father, coom heim with
me now,&#8221; and a bright little star was placed in Mr. Rowe&#8217;s
crown, Mike Burke all the time whistling enquiringly,
&#8220;Will there be any stars in my crown?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While you are on the subject of &#8216;lifting&#8217; the craft, I
wish some one of our gifted speakers would say a few
words upon the &#8216;Telegraph and Telephone Life Insurance
Association.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I notice the sentiment on the subject is general,&#8221; said
Chairman Baker, &#8220;and that it is highly approved of by
all of our friends assembled. Much good work along these
lines is at present being done in the Chicago office, which
I am proud to say never takes a back seat from any place
when it comes to doing things right. The present Chicago
agent for the Telegraph and Telephone Life Insurance
Association, Mr. Edward F. Hatch, has many applications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
to his &#8216;wampum belt,&#8217; as Hawkeye Bill would put it, and
this same spirit should be more manifest all over the
country. Just see what immeasurable good the association
does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All these remarks are well timed and I agree with the
speakers, but let us have a little fun now. Can&#8217;t Sam
Bracken get out his stalwart nine from the Chicago 1883
bunch and play W. H. Cummings of St. Louis a game of
base ball?&#8221; Thus spoke Fred Catlin and many left the
club room to witness the game, which was played with
much spirit, Chicago, of course, winning with a decisive
score.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to note the absolute democracy of
feeling pervading the denizens of Mars; there was no
feeling of seeming superiority displayed by any one person
over another; all were equal and on the same level and
plane. Former superintendents were pleased to hob-nob
with their linemen and chiefs and operators linked arms
like brothers and all differences and distinctions were
wiped out forever.</p>

<p>Is it not too bad that such a feeling is impossible, or
seems to be so, on Earth at the present time?</p>

<p>Conversation, visiting and &#8220;get acquainted&#8221; knots of
telegraph men and women now ensued and it was good
to notice the many familiar faces of those who came
loitering along to take part in the happy meeting.</p>

<p>There was Emil Shape, so well known a few years ago
in Milwaukee; George Brigham, from Toledo; John W.
Moreland, from San Francisco; Commodore Haines, from
Los Angeles; John Henderson, from Portland; John and
William Grier, from Salt Lake; ex-manager Snider, from
Cheyenne; Frank B. Knight, from Omaha; James Swan,
from Minneapolis, and many others.</p>

<p>John Henderson, who was acquainted while on Earth
with all of these gentlemen, was kept busy in introducing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
one to the other, his introduction being accompanied by a
humorous sally. Mr. Henderson was in a very pleasant
spirit and greeted the Grier brothers most affectionately,
calling upon Tom Kehoe, Joe Hurley, Mike Burke, Mike
Conway and W. B. Hibbard to come and take a seat close
by where they could all talk uninterruptedly.</p>

<p>Oh yes, here is Joe Sears; the last time I saw him he
was in Pioche, Nev., and here is George Millar from
Austin, and James Farrell, from Carson, and Tom Booth
and &#8220;Graphy&#8221; from Virginia City.</p>

<p>And now that we are all gathered together and have all
the time that there is and we have no work to do at the
office, we will enjoy ourselves to the utmost by relating
our experiences for the benefit of those who are left
behind, knowing that all of our remarks will be carefully
chronicled in the Telegraph and Telephone Age through
its special correspondent on the planet Mars, Fred B.
Moxon.</p>

<p>Then followed a series of story telling, of experiences,
humorous and pathetic.</p>

<p>The news had been received of the generous Christmas
present given to all employes by the Western Union
Telegraph Company, which fact occasioned many pleasant
remarks from its former operators, accompanied also by a
doleful remonstrance from the former stockholders of the
company, who could not understand the occasion of this
uncalled for extravagance.</p>

<p>A committee composed of Frank Jaynes, William B.
Hibbard, Colonel J. J. Dickey and E. P. Wright, framed
resolutions of appreciation to be transmitted to the president
of the Western Union Telegraph Company, Newcomb
Carlton, indicating the feeling existing among the former
co-laborers now on the planet Mars toward that company.</p>

<p>The meeting is still in session.</p>

CALIFORNIA ELECTS A PRESIDENT</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHILE the telegraph boys of Chicago were enjoying
themselves and making merry, a great
noise was heard up the line, and a cloud of
dust was discernible, acting as a precursor of
the California contingent, who had just learned of the
recent election on Earth and desired to share their honors
with their brothers there.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to come to California if you want to elect
a president,&#8221; exclaimed Commodore R. R. Haines, so long
known to the fraternity during his life at Los Angeles.</p>

<p>&#8220;California creates wonders and now it is going into
competition with Ohio and is developing presidents,&#8221; sang
out James Gamble, and at the mention of his name, there
came a mighty applause from all in the grand stand and
bleachers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad that California is diversifying its products,
for if we are to give to the world only our product of
native sons we will be having too much competition from
among our oriental neighbors,&#8221; quoth Frank Jaynes, handsome
and blithe as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we have come to celebrate California&#8217;s part in
the election of 1916 and let us do it up right,&#8221; interrupted
Geo. Senf, &#8220;and I believe the Chicago club will excuse
us for butting in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome, Gentlemen,&#8221; said President A. L. Baker,
&#8220;and we invite you cordially to sit at our merry round
table and partake of the intellectual feast which we always
have to offer a brother telegrapher.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among the California contingent came a number who
had visited San Francisco, tarried awhile and returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the effete East. Some flippantly remarked that they
&#8220;beat&#8221; it East.</p>

<p>Among this number were the following gentlemen: Jeff
Prentice, John Moreland, Harry Converse, David Crawford,
John Yontz, William Skinner, George Millar, James
Farrell, William Cohen, W. J. Wallis and many other
bright lights in the telegraph sky.</p>

<p>Dr. O. P. S. Plummer, the first telegraph superintendent
in Oregon and dear old James H. Guild, were there hob-nobbing
and both bright and happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am figuring on getting up a telegrapher&#8217;s tournament
up here on the planet Mars,&#8221; said Johnnie Henderson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you figuring upon giving your audience an exhibition
of &#8216;slow&#8217; sending?&#8221; asked Billy Dumars, but John
denied the soft impeachment and declared that he believed
the talent up in Mars would put the earthly inhabitants to
the blush, and the idea was taken up and talked over until
everyone was enthused. The day of the tournament was
fixed for Washington&#8217;s birthday.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will show them how I used to send in the spring of
&#8217;73,&#8221; said Marsh Greene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I will give them an illustration of fast work,
right off the reel, as I took it from C. F. Stumm for the
edification of Professor Morse,&#8221; exclaimed Louis A.
Somers, as he carelessly toyed with a very noticeable
medal pinned to his coat lapel, bearing some mystic telegraphic
symbols.</p>

<p>It being all settled about the tournament, its date and
place, the club resolved itself into its original form and
several hours were devoted to getting acquainted with the
president-makers and welcoming them to this haven of
rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bug&#8221; sending versus hand sending was taken up and
discussed, the old-timer advocating the old style and giving
his reasons therefor, but this was all dissipated when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
coterie of &#8220;bug&#8221; men rallied to the support of their favorite
weapon, giving some startling illustrations of the efficacy
of their machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;It puts you on your mettle,&#8221; cried one. &#8220;You never
know till you make the sense if it is going to be &#8216;pome,&#8217;
&#8216;home&#8217; or &#8216;some.&#8217; It keeps your brain active and working
and does not allow you to get mentally lazy with your
work, which, unhappily, is too much the case with all
telegraph operators.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have your nerve to make such a statement, but I
really believe you are more than half right after all,&#8221; said
George Baxter, &#8220;for I know myself that it is easier to
sleep than to think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and it is more blessed to send than to receive,&#8221;
broke in Al Stoner, who had been an interested listener to
the discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the &#8216;bug&#8217; has come to stay until I have improved
my flash light key, which will send and do its own receiving
at the rate of 1,000 messages an hour,&#8221; interposed
Nick Burke, and his audience smiled a little bit unbelievingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will have a song from H. C. Maynard,&#8221; but he
asked to be excused, as he believed he was getting signals
from the Earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing but echoes from Verdun, you ought to
know that,&#8221; said Albert J. Desson as he came in arm and
arm with Dan C. Schull, both of Cleveland.</p>

<p>Some unthinking people may wrongfully accuse the
writer of a seeming levity in dealing with the people who
have gone before, but they are certainly in error, for that
is furthest from his intentions.</p>

<p>Our once earthly friends dwell in a different thought,
with different aspirations and desires, none of which is of
the Earth, earthy. They retain only their happy state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
consciousness, and have no remorse or nuts to crack, on
this side of Jordan.</p>

<p>Much favorable comment was heard about the Christmas
present given the employes by the prevailing earthly
telegraph company and many complimentary remarks were
made concerning the present organization and its management</p>

<p>&#8220;The telegraph is in its infancy,&#8221; remarked Gen. Anson
Stager, &#8220;and I have been taught many things I never
dreamed of in my philosophy, Horatio, and I am willing
to admit we were all asleep to the business end of the
telegraph in 1876, but it is coming now and the only rival
of the telegraph will be Uncle Sam and his fast mail.</p>

<p>&#8220;New usages will constantly be made of the telegraph,
new innovations instituted, a more modern system of delivery
will be found and speed will be added to efficiency
and accuracy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember when we thought gross earnings of seven
millions were startling and it is hard to realize that the
present figures show nearly ten times that amount. Well,
good luck go with it,&#8221; and Gen. Stager took William
Orton&#8217;s arm for a stroll down to nature&#8217;s canal, hard by.</p>

<p>The San Francisco boys sang, &#8220;It is a long way to
California,&#8221; and it seemed evident that they wanted to
talk more about California&#8217;s share in electing a president
than ordinary shop talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think the company will further increase the
boys&#8217; salaries in California because that state elected the
president?&#8221; asked Bob Hamilton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they certainly should, because there is nothing
too good for California,&#8221; replied Ed. Fleming, who was on
hand with Thomas Reynolds, taking in the sights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; said Johnny Lowrey, who strolled in at
this time. &#8220;You are right, there is nothing too good for
a native son.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said President Baker, &#8220;there is only one
thing that we cut out up here on the planet Mars, and that
is all mention of politics. Religion we will discuss at any
time, because we know that religion is nothing more than
getting acquainted with your Maker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are my sentiments, Mr. President,&#8221; said D. W.
Knapp, who had just arrived on a late California express
and who proceeded to shake hands with the old San Francisco
friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have much to tell you of an interesting character,&#8221;
said President Baker, &#8220;but I find that the California boys
have taken away most of our audience to go down to the
canal to see the sights, so we will call this meeting temporarily
adjourned.&#8221;</p>

ECHOES FROM GOTHAM</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE PLEIADES CLUB, of which so much has been
written lately, seems to possess some value based
upon the fact that it brings to the attention of the
old and new-timers the names of former prominent
telegraph people, those who excelled in the art of telegraphy
and those who possessed qualities that made them
shining marks in the eyes of their contemporaries. It is
the intention of the author to cover those sections of the
country where there were well-known members of the
profession. Of course it must be remembered that the
exceptional operators of ye olden days sooner or later
gravitated to the large telegraph centers, such as New
York, Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Boston, San Francisco
and a dozen other cities which have housed at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
time or another the brilliant operators of the past, those
who have left their impress on the fraternity that will not
be effaced for many generations to come. These old-timers
have left their record in printers&#8217; ink. The younger-timers,
as they advance in years, become the old-timers of
tomorrow. Thus history repeats itself.</p>

<p>The eastern coterie of members of the Pleiades Club
without hesitation called upon Alfred S. Downer to preside
over the gathering of the New York contingent.
Manager Downer, who wielded the scepter of authority
in the general operating room at 195 Broadway, New York,
for so many years, was now on a level with those who
worked the way wires in his office. His brother, David R.
Downer, who was never known to utter a stronger swear
word than &#8220;My stars,&#8221; was the assistant manager. He
related that he had reprimanded hundreds of operators for
making errors, then he himself was found guilty of putting
down &#8220;Admiral Jones, Commander Nasty Yard, Brooklyn,
N. Y.&#8221; He admitted that to the day of his retirement from
the service this &#8220;Nasty&#8221; Navy error had haunted him.
The incident was remembered by the old New Yorkers
present, among them being Morris Brick, James H. Largay,
David B. Mitchell, Leslie Bradley, J. H. Dwight, A. S.
Brown, Thomas Kennedy, Thomas Dolan, Fred. W. Baldwin
and many others. This last-named gentleman had
fastened to his belt many practical jokes he had &#8220;pulled
off&#8221; while on Earth. In fact, it was a dull day or busy one
at the wires, whatever the case might be, when Fred.
Baldwin failed to disturb the serenity of the otherwise
calm atmosphere of the operating department with his
mirth-exciting pranks.</p>

<p>Sometimes he was known as &#8220;Old Man Kav,&#8221; and it is
to the credit of the latter that he coaxed every new arrival
in the office to work extra the first day or night as the
case might be for &#8220;Old Man Kav&#8221; without compensation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
&#8220;Old Man Kav&#8221; may have been a myth but he was an
expensive one to the new arrivals. There never was so
much sickness or dire distress attached to anyone compared
with the excuses advanced by &#8220;Old Man Kav&#8221; to work the
new comers or rather introduce them to the New York
fraternity, persuading them by carefully worded notes to
work for him.</p>

<p>The New York force was large and it necessarily had its
quota of cranks. When they became generally known as
such their lives were made, to say the least, unhappy at
times. John Lenhart frequently found the desk at which
he worked fumigated with limburger cheese, but who
performed the ceremony no one could ever find out.</p>

<p>Every new man on the force was instructed by note
signed &#8220;Old Man Kav&#8221; to hand his worn-out pens and
penholders to irritable Tom Kennedy, the wire chief, but
to discover who issued such instructions was more than
the office detective could find out.</p>

<p>No married operator in the New York force thirty or
forty years ago was considered first-class until he had
purchased in one of the suburban New Jersey or Long
Island towns a home of his own. It was not a difficult task
to him to figure how six good laying hens could yield a
sufficient number of eggs, the profit on which would pay
for his home in five years. One of these lightning calculating
operators had drummed up quite a few customers
for his fresh-laid eggs. He brought them to the office each
morning, hid them away until noon, when he delivered
them to his customers. It did not take long, &#8220;Old Man
Kav&#8221; said, for him to size up the hen merchant&#8217;s tricks.
He speedily made arrangements with a local egg dealer
to furnish him with a few dozen eggs that had seen better
days and some previous years. As the fresh eggs arrived
each morning and the unsuspecting owner was busy at his
wire, the old-time product was substituted for the strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
fresh variety. The reader can imagine the nature of the
language that was exchanged during the following week
between the embryo egg merchant and his customers, some
of whom were officials of the company, more vividly than
anything we can say. The office detective again failed to
locate the guilty party and the egg merchant speedily went
out of business.</p>

<p>Tom Finnigan, who barricaded the entrance to the operating
department with his portly form, was a character
different from anyone else that ever graced the New York
telegraph ranks. His utterances were dry and crispy and
served to keep the &#8220;good fellows&#8221; on the force supplied
with ample material as a basis for their jokes. It was
Tom&#8217;s duty to announce to the manager those at the door
who wished to see him. One day a Texas operator was
an applicant for a position. Tom reported his arrival to
Manager Downer, who asked Finnigan if the fellow looked
as though he was a good, fast telegrapher. Finnigan
quickly responded &#8220;I think he is. He tells me he came up
from Texas on a cyclone.&#8221; The manager, turning to Finnigan,
said, &#8220;You have my authority to hire him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chairman Downer was an attentive listener to all that
had been said concerning his management and he nodded
affirmatively as the old stories were retold.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to relate how the improvident
telegraphers in the olden days spent their money. They
were paid every Friday. With the extra work that was
forced upon them they earned from $20 to $50 per week.
On Friday night their suppers cost them two to three
dollars; on Saturday night one and a half to two dollars
and a half; on Sunday night a dollar to a dollar and a
half; on Monday night from fifty cents to a dollar; on
Tuesday night from twenty-five cents to fifty cents, and
on Wednesday and Thursday nights, ten to fifteen cents.
Frequently money had to be borrowed to pay for Thursday&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
meal, but as the office boys could be depended upon
for a &#8220;touch&#8221; the old-timers never went hungry.</p>

<p>The formalities were brought to a close to give the
former New Yorkers an opportunity to greet their old
employer.</p>

THE PLANET MARS ENJOYS A<br />
TELEGRAPHERS&#8217; TOURNAMENT</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS THE planet Mars has more than 600 days to its
year, and as time is of no moment in that delightful
abode, Washington&#8217;s birthday could be celebrated
anytime convenient to the members of the
Pleiades Club, and accordingly the telegraph tournament
was scheduled to come off when all preparations were
completed.</p>

<p>Such bustling, hurrying and skurrying was seldom witnessed
on Earth and the telegraph man was in evidence
everywhere. Visitors were apprised of what was in store
and even the laity took a great interest in what was about
to transpire. In addition to talent from the United States
and Canada, there were applications from foreign countries
of operators who had been noted in their profession
in their respective lands.</p>

<p>The unanimous choice of a president was Fred Catlin,
of New York, who demurred a little, as he hoped to be a
participant or judge, but finally acquiesced, and was duly
installed as president.</p>

<p>The committee of arrangements was composed of the
following well known gentlemen:</p>

<p>R. H. Rochester, A. S. Brown, Dave McAneeny, J. H.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Dwight, John Brant, Court Cunningham, Marion H. Kerner
and D. Harmon.</p>

<p>The judges were composed of the following:</p>

<p>Madison Buell, G. W. Gardanier, W. B. Somerville,
Belvidere Brooks, C. H. Summers, E. C. Cockey and J. C.
Hinchman.</p>

<p>The usual exponents of &#8220;bug&#8221; and hand sending were
present to demonstrate the advantages of their respective
methods, but there were many present who had never
heard of or seen the &#8220;bug&#8221; and were anxious to see its
merits tested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be on hand with my first typewriter, constructed
in 1868, and will undertake to show how I copied the
president&#8217;s message that year,&#8221; said E. Payson Porter, and
the Chicago members of the club applauded loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I will bring my old register with me, that I
used for so long when I was manager at Akron, Ohio, and
show you how I copied so much which never came,&#8221; remarked
ex-manager Allen, formerly of Akron.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I will give you an illustration how to read by the
&#8216;back stroke,&#8217;&#8221; said W. H. Kelsey.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, gentlemen,&#8221; interrupted Fred Catlin, &#8220;we
will be glad to hear from all, but we have to get down to
business and appoint several important committees to carry
out this good work.</p>

<p>&#8220;In addition to the usual programme in such cases, there
is also going to be an illustration of &#8216;ham&#8217; sending, also a
demonstration of a beginner at the key.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this juncture, two young men entered the room, each
carrying a typewriter and a Martin vibroplex, similar to
those used upon the terrestrial planet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to give a preliminary exhibition of what
the youngsters can do with a &#8216;bug&#8217; and &#8216;mill.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure, it does not require as much activity or
muscle to telegraph nowadays as it did formerly, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
we were compelled to make twelve to eighteen copies with
a stylus.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are now in an entirely different class than we were
formerly and the results are greater than they used to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;The operator of twenty-five years ago was necessarily,
in some respects, the superior of the present generation,
but he could not possibly turn out the work that is being
performed daily and hourly by his latter-day brother with
such ease and speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;While our younger brothers are getting their instruments
in order, we will rig up a Morse set and have W. L.
Waugh give us an illustration of his beautiful sending
while William T. Loper will demonstrate how he used to
take fourteen copies of manifold with a stylus in the olden
days in St. Louis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I used to see Billy Loper do this when I was night
chief in St. Louis and he certainly did it well,&#8221; said Charles
J. Lawson, who sauntered in from the rear, when he heard
Mr. Loper&#8217;s name mentioned.</p>

<p>While the audience applauded the expected treat,
Messrs. Loper and Waugh squared themselves for the fray.</p>

<p>Like shot poured into a funnel, clicked the dots and
dashes, Mr. Loper methodically and with the greatest ease
copying the perfect Morse with his favorite stylus on
fourteen manifold sheets, in his own beautiful characteristic
writing.</p>

<p>For one hour and without a break, the twain worked fast
but gracefully, much Phillips&#8217; code being used and after
counting the hour&#8217;s work, it was ascertained that two
thousand eight hundred words had been transmitted.</p>

<p>Specimens of the work were distributed among the
admiring audience, who were loud in their praise of Mr.
Loper&#8217;s copper-plate chirography and the sheets were
given out as souvenirs of the occasion.</p>

<p>It was noticeable that after this exhibition, few of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
operators from foreign countries enrolled themselves as
competitors at the coming tournament.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s give the young fellows a show now,&#8221; said Fred
Catlin, and the two young men previously mentioned, one
named Smith, from Birmingham, Postal, and one Brown,
from Atlanta, Western Union, came to the front.</p>

<p>The quick, jerky, &#8220;bug&#8221; sending seemed marvelous to
some of the very old-timers and it seemed a little bit difficult
for them at first to so adjust their brains to keep up
with the merry jingle. The receiving operator, also, was
doing some marvelous stunts.</p>

<p>While the sender was transmitting at top-notch speed,
the Birmingham boy took out a cigarette, which he lighted
and began to puff with as much <i>sang froid</i> as though he
were in a down-town cafe, never missing a word or even
a punctuation mark.</p>

<p>For one hour this great exhibition kept up, at the end
of which time one hundred and thirty messages had been
transmitted and copied without an error.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is splendid work,&#8221; said the president, &#8220;and shows
clearly how the &#8216;bug&#8217; and &#8216;mill&#8217; have it on even the most
famous old-timers. It shows plainly how mechanical devices
supplant brain material, and after all these are
god-sends to the latter day generation of operators.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody interested in the doings of the telegraph
were talking of the day&#8217;s proceedings, commending the
great work of the old-timers and marvelling at the speed
and accuracy of the &#8220;up-to-the-minute&#8221; telegrapher.</p>

<p>Many new applications were received from those
anxious to partake in the coming tournament, and files of
back copies of the Telegraph and Telephone Age were
looked over and read with the idea to conform with the
usual modus of procedure on such occasions.</p>

<p>Everybody was on the <i>qui vive</i>, but all was harmony
and a feeling of brotherly love pervaded the inhabitants
of this joyous planet.</p>

WASHINGTON&#8217;S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION<br />
ON THE PLANET MARS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALL OF the telegraph people residing on the planet
Mars had gathered around in the grand stand to
get a front view in the tournament which was
scheduled to come off February 22, Washington&#8217;s
birthday. There was no crowding or elbowing or pushing,
as there was a place for everyone, and everybody was in
his place.</p>

<p>A gigantic sounder was in the middle of the arena
specially arranged so all could hear, and many good-natured
jokes were told on this instrument while waiting
for the big event to take place.</p>

<p>All ex-members of the profession were there and there
were no goats or black sheep, and only joy and happiness
prevailed. It did one&#8217;s soul good to see the forms and
faces of the old linemen and battery men who were in
the assemblage, all of whom were on the alert for line or
battery trouble, just as they were erstwhile on Earth, and
all seemed anxious to do something to make the tournament
an affair never to be forgotten. They included such
old-time linemen as George Melton, Harry Collins, Joe
Keenan, Tom Dushane, John Crouch, Tommy Calahan,
Delos Rich, Jimmy Brush and many others well known in
their day.</p>

<p>At this juncture a great noise was heard across the river
Styxx&mdash;the name is spelled with a double &#8220;x&#8221; on Mars.
Shots from fowling pieces, small pistols, hurrahing and
cheering of all kinds were distinguished behind a column
of dust which, presently clearing away, disclosed to view
an immense army of regulars and irregulars, some clad in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
uniform, bearing rifles, but mostly composed of a uniformed
delegation bearing weapons of a more ancient date.</p>

<p>Fifes and drums were playing, adding inspiration to the
scene. A herald appeared before the grand stand and
announced that this being Washington&#8217;s birthday it was
only immensely proper to pay the respects to that great
personage, inasmuch as he was coming with his Continental
troops to celebrate the day and participate in the
tournament.</p>

<p>Just then the first column of General Washington&#8217;s
army swung into line, bivouacking on the green sward
fronting the grand stand. A long list of generals and
presidents arrived in carriages, but Thomas Jefferson,
with true Jeffersonian simplicity, appeared mounted on a
milk white steed.</p>

<p>&#8220;First in war, first in peace,&#8221; began Abraham Lincoln,
addressing the &#8220;Father&#8221; of his country, but he was interrupted
by General Washington, who extended his hand,
remarking &#8220;And I will shake hands with him who is first
in the hearts of his countrymen.&#8221; Mr. Lincoln agreed to
share that honor with his illustrious patron and friend,
and the cannons belched forth the regulation presidential
salute.</p>

<p>A little hatchet with a cherry handle was suspended
from General Washington&#8217;s belt, a little after the style
in which the Scotchman wears his paint brush.</p>

<p>Many old British generals were present but not in line.
Marquis De Lafayette, smiling and full of bonhomme,
went up and down the line, shaking hands with the presidents
and soldiers alike.</p>

<p>The bulletin board on the planet Mars is on the azure
sky and an electric pen propelled by wireless telegraph
copies off in red ink, not unlike tongues of fire, indelibly
all items of news.</p>

<p>George Washington and his heroes were reading the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
latest bulletins from the big war, and as they read a look
of deep concern covered the faces of all. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this
late news,&#8221; said the general, &#8220;but I know my country is
in safe hands and that President Wilson will be backed
by congress in everything he may want to undertake. But
this is not war, it is barbarism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We fought like gentlemen,&#8221; ejaculated Lord Cornwall,
and General Washington doffed his hat to acknowledge
the compliment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be all right to delay giving any advice to
President Wilson until he really needs it,&#8221; continued Gen.
Washington, &#8220;but I wish to inform him that he has a
mighty army up here in Mars who will appear at the
proper time to lend aid and assistance to his efforts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, my illustrious predecessor, come with me and
after a little speech-making we will partake of the hospitality
of the Pleiades Club.&#8221; Thus spoke Abraham
Lincoln as he took the arm of George Washington for a
stroll around the grand stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was very much interested in telegraphy and telegraph
operators during my career at the White House,&#8221; Mr.
Lincoln continued, &#8220;and I wish to introduce you to some
of those I met and who will, no doubt, take part in this
tournament, now about to take place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had nothing but &#8216;wig-wagging&#8217; from the tops of
high hills and some signal fires during my time,&#8221; said
General Washington, &#8220;and this new invention by my dear
friend, Professor Morse, came to serve his country in good
stead, and I will be delighted to meet all your old telegraph
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two presidents then met the following old-timers
who were in the United States&#8217; service during the Civil
War: H. A. Bogardus, W. K. Applebaugh, S. M. Brown,
Madison Buell, W. W. Burhans, M. J. Childs, Eli Cole,
C. D. Hammond, J. D. Truax, Isaac McMichael, J. La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Bonte, G. H. Peck, W. B. Somerville, L. B. Spellman,
O. K. Newton, F. A. Nash, Geo. Purdon, and many others.</p>

<p>President Fred Catlin of the telegraphers&#8217; tournament
decided it would be more patriotic to devote the day to
entertaining the great presidents and generals in a different
way and let the harder part of the programme come
along later, and his views were accepted.</p>

<p>The members of the United States Military Corps were
everywhere introducing and being introduced, Fred Loomis,
George Baxter and Marion H. Kerner being particularly
happy.</p>

<p>General Grant was surrounded by a throng of admirers.
He proved himself not very strong on the &#8220;send,&#8221; but a
most cheerful listener.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was with Grant,&#8221; began Fred Loomis.</p>

<p>&#8220;When were you with Grant?&#8221; queried George Baxter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that is just in the song,&#8221; was the laughing reply,
and even General Grant smiled as he remembered about
the tramp &#8220;who was with Grant&#8221; just ten years before
the war.</p>

<p>No attempt was made to give an exhibition of fast
sending or receiving, as the United States Military Corps
were too busy in showing attention to former officers, with
whom now, however, they hob-nobbed like college chums.</p>

<p>It was a glorious day, filled with enthusiasm, glowing
speeches and patriotic sentiment.</p>

<p>General Washington&#8217;s old body-guard, &#8220;Sam,&#8221; was on
hand and he took much delight in relating the oft-repeated
story how he approached Mr. Washington one day, doffing
his hat at the same time.</p>

<p>To everyone&#8217;s surprise, General Washington immediately
took off his own head-gear.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it that you take off your hat to a colored man?&#8221;
was asked by the English ambassador.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>&#8220;Because he took off his hat to me, and I will not permit
even a negro to outdo me in politeness,&#8221; replied the
general, and the little incident became historical.</p>

SOME SPLENDID TELEGRAPHING</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">&#8220;ARE YOU gwine to be a member of the Pleiades
Club?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I is; indeed, I is.&#8221;</p>

<p>This refrain was sung with much gusto by the
members of the telegraph club in session at the Telegraphers&#8217;
Tabernacle, on the planet Mars, on the afternoon of
the day set apart for the telegraphers&#8217; tournament. The
song was set to the music of the &#8220;Old Lime Kiln Club&#8221;
and was enthusiastically received.</p>

<p>From all points of the compass were arriving in balloons,
dirigibles, aeroplanes, members of the craft anxious to be
present at the big blow-out. Submarines, only on pleasure
bent, however, came up the Hesperian canal, filled with
the operators of the olden days; across the River &#8220;Styxx&#8221;
arrived colony after colony of ex-telegraph officials, operators
and linemen, but there was no elbowing to obtain
a front seat.</p>

<p>President Fred Catlin looked magnificent as he called
the vast assemblage to order. This took some little time,
as there were many new arrivals and much interest manifested
by those already in the Tabernacle to see who the
newcomers were; there was also much visiting, good humor
and hilarity, and everybody was happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a preliminary,&#8221; said Mr. Catlin, &#8220;I will take pleasure
in giving our friends an illustration of how the Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Associated Press was worked in 1875. We will have
Albert S. Ayres, whom you all knew as &#8216;Patsey&#8217; Ayres, do
the sending at Cincinnati and the following gentlemen
will do the receiving: at Indianapolis, Milton Goewey; St.
Louis, John W. McDonald of Texas; Louisville, Charles
Newton; Memphis, Ed. Foote; Nashville, James U. Rust;
Chattanooga, Jack St. Clair; New Orleans, Taylor Adams,
and at Galveston, Alex. Sinnott.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the mention of each of these names, a shout of
approval shook the audience, which indicated that all were
well and favorably known.</p>

<p>&#8220;Patsey&#8221; Ayres had been fumbling with the key for
several minutes, screwing it up until there was less than
a thousandth part of an inch play, and then began a series
of dots and dashes, fast and furious, but beautiful to listen
to and like the music of a grand opera to the trained ears
of the telegraphers present.</p>

<p>For an hour or more Mr. Ayers continued his tireless
and musical performance on the key, but never once was
it necessary for any of the receivers to break him. All of
these operators were wizards with the stylus and many in
the audience took back with them a manifold sheet as a
souvenir of the occasion.</p>

<p>This was a particularly happy event and recalled to
mind to many the great receiving of forty years ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;I find that you are so much pleased with this event
that I shall take pleasure in giving you an illustration of
how &#8216;C. U. B.&#8217; was sent over the Overland in early days
from Chicago,&#8221; said the president, &#8220;and I have called for
the following gentlemen to officiate:</p>

<p>&#8220;J. De Witt Congdon will do the pitching in Chicago
and the following will do the receiving at their respective
offices: &#8216;Dad&#8217; Armstrong at Omaha, John Wilkie at Cheyenne,
George Merrifield at Denver, Edward C. Keeler at
Ogden, Jack Wolfenden at Salt Lake, P. A. Rowe at Elko,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Davey Crawford at Virginia City, Joe Wood of Boston
and E. H. Beardsley at Sacramento, George Bowker and
John Lowrey at San Francisco, John Donnelly at Los
Angeles, Billy Leigh and G. W. Thurman at Portland,
Sam McIntosh at New Westminster, B. C., and John
Henderson at Victoria, B. C.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said Mr. Catlin, &#8220;this is a long circuit
and you see you can have any kind of weather you desire,
from extreme cold to the torrid zone, almost, but this
never interferes with a good operator, and now the performance
will begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Mr. Congdon&#8217;s sending was not as beautiful as
was that of Mr. Ayres, it reached each point from the
extreme northwest down to the region of Catalina Island,
each dot and dash arriving at its terminal in perfect shape.</p>

<p>This was certainly a great feat and it was much talked
about by the happy visitors.</p>

<p>There was some delay in making the preparations and
before the main event was reached it was suggested by
Hank Bogardus that the business be suspended for the
time being, so that all could witness a game of base ball
about to open on the Elysian Fields, at the rear of the
tournament hall. &#8220;Those base ball enthusiasts,&#8221; said
Bogy, &#8220;will make such a noise that it will be impossible
to hear our instruments in the hall, and I for one do not
want to have the beautiful Morse that will be in evidence
drowned out.&#8221;</p>

<p>All agreed to the suggestion and forthwith there was a
parade from the hall to the ball grounds of famous
telegraphers that shone in the earthly telegraph firmament
in years gone by.</p>

<p>It was interesting to hear the remarks made by these
former &#8220;knights of the key&#8221; as the different plays were
made, showing plainly that they had not lost any of their
former enthusiasm for the national game.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>&#8220;Who is the manager of the office on the grounds?&#8221;
inquired Billy Blanchard. &#8220;Bring him up here so he can
enjoy the game with us,&#8221; but before that official could be
found and Billy&#8217;s request carried out the game had finished
and the telegraph crowd returned to the hall to take up
their work where they left off. When they got back and
seated it was evident that they were hardly in the right
frame of mind, after the excitement over the base ball
game, to resume the details of their own work, so President
Catlin said that as there was no hurry to finish the
work in hand he suggested that the tournament be adjourned
until the next day. This would give all hands a
chance to get over the effects of their base ball experience
and be able to concentrate their thoughts upon the more
important work in hand.</p>

<p>This suggestion was gladly accepted and all filed out
and boarded a canal craft for a ride down one of the
Martian waterways in the beautiful moonlight.</p>

CLEVELAND DAY ON THE PLANET<br />
MARS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE BULLETIN board, which was the azure blue
sky of Mars, contained the names of many new
arrivals by fast express train from the terrestrial
planet. These bulletins were seared into the bright
sky by an electric pen wielded by wireless telegraph, which
left an impression plainly visible and legible to all on the
planet, and as there is no slumber or tired feeling on the
planet Mars, all of its sojourners were on the <i>qui vive</i> in
anticipation of meeting old friends.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>&#8220;Ah! There&#8217;s Nelson A. Buell, of Cleveland, Ohio,&#8221;
cried out A. H. Vanduzer, and instantly the Cleveland
fraternity marshalled into line, as one great body, to
welcome the arrival of one of its loved members while
on Earth.</p>

<p>It was easy to recognize the face and form of the former
manager of the Cleveland office, with his Napoleonic face,
from which radiated love and kindness for his brother man.</p>

<p>There was a long list of friends and former associates
to greet Mr. Buell, operators, linemen, clerks and messengers
being in the gathering.</p>

<p>Among those assembled to greet the newly arrived were
the following:</p>

<p>E. P. Wright, A. H. Vanduzer, Chas. H. Lapp, L. A.
Somers, A. J. Desson, Nick Kerver, C. F. Stumm, Geo. T.
Lowe, George Phillips, S. B. Roberts, G. H. Wadsworth,
E. T. Tindall, O. A. Gurley, E. C. Stockwell, W. R.
Williams, Richard Babbitt, D. C. Shull, J. N. McNamara,
Marshall S. Green, Thomas Callahan, John J. McCart,
George E. Hinman and his brother Walter, W. H. Eckman,
Jas. P. McKinstry, George W. Baxter, Dan R. Francis,
Harry Collins, George Melton, George Winston Patteson,
Frank G. Beach, W. H. Spencer, Ed Schemerhorn, Hank
Cowan, Charlie Phillips, Ed. C. Jenney, Ed. B. Beecher,
J. H. Wade, Anson Stager, Wm. Hunter, Charlie Gorham,
Hank W. Stager, Tom Miles, Thos. H. Gould and others.</p>

<p>Many telegraph people from adjacent cities were also
in evidence and such dear old faces as Zeke Butman, of
Fremont, Ohio; Dewitt C. Hill, of Painesville, Ohio;
William Bryant, of Erie, Pa.; Ed Burke and P. F. McCarthy,
of Sandusky; John A. Townsend, of Dunkirk,
N. Y.; Frank Ross and John Owens, of Columbus, Ohio;
Henry W. Wynkoop, of Crestline; Wm. Kline, Jr., Charles
O. and George M. Brigham, of Toledo, and Mark Luce,
of Titusville, Pa.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>Mr. Buell&#8217;s arrival was hailed with much delight and
when he announced that the next meeting of the Old Time
Telegraphers was to be held in Cleveland, the enthusiasm
became greater, for all remembered the previous meeting
of that Association in the Forest City in 1886 and the
good time everyone had upon that occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will never forget the ride to Rocky River,&#8221; said Mr.
Stumm.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I will always remembers the trip to Put-in-Bay
and Kelly&#8217;s Island,&#8221; remarked O. A. Gurley.</p>

<p>All of the members had something pleasant to relate
and all gave out the hope that their wishes in the matter
could reach their former earthly colleagues.</p>

<p>&#8220;That matter will be attended to in the highest style of
the art, as I will write the subject up and hand it to Fred
Moxon for transmission to his earthly partner,&#8221; said
George Hinman, as he proceeded to sharpen his pencil.</p>

<p>Late copies of Telegraph and Telephone Age, brought
to the planet Mars by Nelson A. Buell were passed around
and eagerly scanned and the doings of the Pleiades Club
were favorably commented upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;While the secretary of the Old Timers, John Brant, is
reading felicitous telegrams at the Cleveland meeting from
terrestrial friends, I hope it will not be amiss for us to
extend our congratulations to that honorable body and I
suggest that a committee of the Cleveland Old Timers now
here assembled be appointed to draft a suitable and loving
message for our friends to be read on the occasion of the
1917 reunion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus spoke E. P. Wright, and cheer after cheer greeted
his suggestion and Gen. Anson Stager, Jeptha H. Wade,
Frank G. Beach and Thomas Callahan were appointed
such committee, which showed the democratic spirit of the
assemblage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that I will send a private wireless message<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to my old friend, Allen A. Briggs, and tell him what a nice
place it is up here,&#8221; said Hank Stager, and many others
fell into line to do the same stunt.</p>

<p>Presidents Garfield and McKinley, both members of the
Ohio Society, stopped to read the bulletins and to shake
hands with Nelson Buell, whom the late presidents remembered
particularly well for his ever-gentle courtesy
when they met in the telegraph office.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will watch with keen interest the occurrences at
the next Old Timers&#8217; meeting, and while not regretting
being present, we will extend our hearty congratulations
to our worthy brothers in session.&#8221; This seemed to be
the consensus of opinion, heartily expressed, which was
handed to Mr. Moxon, with the remark, &#8220;More to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it appears that the doings of our earthly brothers
are being solicitously watched over by those engaged in
the same line of business and who have gone before us,
and we are never for a moment left alone, even to our
innermost thoughts and desires.</p>

<p>The railroad superintendents of telegraph as well as the
commercial superintendents are forming an association on
the planet Mars and a report of the meeting and the names
of those present will be the topic of a future chapter in
the Pleiades Club series.</p>

PLANET MARS ENTERTAINS RAILROAD<br />
TELEGRAPH SUPERINTENDENTS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was a large number of sailing craft on the
Hesperian canal, on the planet Mars, all headed
in the same direction and all evidently bound on
the same mission. There were also some small
steamers which kept up a fusillade of whistles extending
&#8220;73&#8221; in Morse signals to the other craft. On board these
vessels there was a lively lot of men, with a fair sprinkling
of ladies, all beaming with smiles and good nature. This
gay crowd was en route to attend the gathering of the
railroad and commercial superintendents of telegraph
which was booked to occur April 22.</p>

<p>The meeting was to take place in the Telegraphers&#8217;
Tabernacle and everybody was asked to join, for as I
mentioned before, there is no class distinction on the
planet Mars. There was a long list of names and a long
array of forms and faces very familiar to the denizens
of Earth.</p>

<p>The first one to alight from the steamer was Chas. W.
Hammond, whose once serious face was now wreathed
with smiles and good humor. He stopped to shake hands
with his many friends who gathered around him and to
crack some of his old jokes with them, for he is as dearly
loved on the planet Mars as he was on Mother Earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, there, Charlie,&#8221; exclaimed James W. Stacey,
extending his hand to Hammond. &#8220;I have not seen you
since you came down to Houston to visit,&#8221; and the first
superintendent of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
telegraph system smiled at his former colleague. Merry
sallies passed between these gentlemen and the crowd
proceeded up the little hillock to the Tabernacle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>&#8220;Well, if there is not my old friend and patron, Henry
W. Wynkoop, all the way from Crestline, Ohio, and O. H.
Booth from Mansfield, Ohio,&#8221; and both gentlemen, arm
in arm, bowed their acknowledgments to a host of their
former co-workers.</p>

<p>And here we have still another Ohio railroad superintendent
as the form of Wm. Kline, Jr., came down the
line accompanied by George A. Beach. Mr. Kline was for
many years with the Lake Shore at Toledo, Ohio, and has
graduated more first class operators from his road than
any other superintendent in the country, all of whom
esteemed and loved their chief.</p>

<p>George A. Beach, also from Toledo, where he spent so
many years with the Wabash Railroad, accompanied by
Joseph Keenan was surrounded by a number of old friends
and colleagues.</p>

<p>Frank Vandenburg, from the Southern Pacific, San
Francisco, and Col. John J. Dickey, of the Union Pacific,
were recounting the happy days spent on the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember how you favored big batteries, big
relays and big operators,&#8221; ejaculated Col. Dickey, addressing
Vandenburg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I recollect how you used to like to attend the
yearly gatherings of the old-timers,&#8221; returned Vandenburg,
with a broad smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right you are, and you can see that I am doing business
at the old stand,&#8221; came from Col. Dickey as he halted to
shake hands with W. B. Hibbard and J. C. Sheldon, who
were passing along in an automobile.</p>

<p>It was a great pleasure to witness the meeting between
Harry C. Hope and U. J. Fry, the former of St. Paul and
the latter of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul road at
Milwaukee. Mr. Hope was never a speechmaker but he
is certainly a most delightful and entertaining single-handed
talker.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>Mr. Fry was in his usual kind and gentle mood and
made inquiries for the many gone before whom he was
anxious to meet.</p>

<p>E. J. Little, from St. Paul, a recent arrival, accompanied
Messrs. Hope and Fry around the Tabernacle, shaking
hands with old friends. Mr. Little brought the latest
telegraph news from the Earth, which was listened to
attentively.</p>

<p>Many old commercial superintendents whose names are
historical with the telegraph now came along in automobiles
to take part in the meeting.</p>

<p>Of course there was the revered S. F. B. Morse, father
of the telegraph, who received a great ovation. There
was C. H. Haskins, so well known to the old Chicagoan,
Col. J. J. S. Wilson, so long with the Western Union at
Chicago; I. McMichael and James Swan of Minneapolis,
C. O. Rowe of Pittsburgh, E. P. Wright of Cleveland, L. C.
Baker of St. Louis, Frank G. Beach of the Atlantic and
Pacific, Cleveland; David Flanery of New Orleans, George
H. Usher of Atlanta, Ga.; C. A. Darlton of Washington,
Asa R. Swift of Chicago, S. A. D. Forristall of Boston,
Sam S. Bogart, Jesse H. Bunnell and E. G. Cochrane of
New York, and George M. Dugan of Tip Top, Ky.</p>

<p>The smiling face of James H. Guild, who was superintendent
for the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company&#8217;s
telegraphs for so long during the pioneer days of
Oregon and Washington, was much in evidence. He was
surrounded by a happy throng of his old boys, who were
relating all the latest news which came up from the Earth.
Mr. Guild had always been a great exponent of total
abstinence and he expressed much pleasure to know that
both Oregon and Washington had gone dry. Many of
the other superintendents readily gave their &#8220;ok&#8221; to Mr.
Guild&#8217;s views.</p>

<p>Frank Jaynes, James Gamble, George Ladd, R. R.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Haines, Peter Lovell and others of the Pacific Coast were
busily engaged in making the day pleasant for all those
in attendance and in this they were cheerfully assisted by
their brothers from the East.</p>

<p>A committee composed of Henry C. Hope, U. J. Fry
and Wm. Kline, Jr., was appointed to draft a telegram of
congratulations to be extended the president of the Association
of Railway Telegraph Superintendents, soon to
convene in Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>Copies of Telegraph and Telephone Age containing the
news of the passing of Charles A. Tinker were read with
much interest and a committee was appointed to watch the
Cannon Ball Express train to welcome that gentleman&#8217;s
arrival on the planet Mars.</p>

<p>The meeting is still in session and it will continue to be
for a day or two, after which there will be the usual
excursion over the little planet, all to be wound up by a
magnificent banquet.</p>

<p>We hope to receive more particulars of the doings of
the meeting for future publication.</p>

CHARLES A. TINKER ARRIVES ON THE<br />
PLANET MARS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE BRIGHT azure sky on the planet Mars, which
serves as a bulletin board for its whilom dwellers,
was covered with news from Mother Earth and
the wireless electric pen was busy at work transcribing
more items of interest to the sojourners.</p>

<p>News from Washington announcing the declaration of
war excited some anxiety and apprehension and each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
article was read and debated upon by everyone. Secretary
Fred Moxon was kept busily engaged in deciphering the
telepathic messages from his earthly friend and arranging
them for the bulletin board.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, ho!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;here is something new,&#8221; as he
copied off the announcement of the passing of Charles
Almerin Tinker.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say Mr. Tinker will not delay in climbing the
Horeb Heights and he is most likely to arrive on the
Thunderbolt Express, which is due tomorrow,&#8221; ejaculated
Moxon, &#8220;and I believe that I will immediately bulletin the
event, knowing that there will be many who will want to
be among the first to welcome him to our Elysian home.
President Lincoln and Secretary Edwin M. Stanton will
want to meet their old friend and comrade; besides, there
is a long list of members of the old United States Military
Corps who will be on hand when the express train arrives.&#8221;</p>

<p>A bulletin was accordingly indited chronicling the
passing of Mr. Tinker and announcing his expected arrival
on the morrow, which attracted much attention.</p>

<p>A regiment, bearing banners with the legends, &#8220;Spirit
of 1865,&#8221; &#8220;The United States Military Telegraph Corps,&#8221;
etc., accompanied by several bands of music playing stirring
airs, came down the line under the leadership of Col.
Marquis D. Crain. The regiment was composed of admirers
of Mr. Tinker and were mostly members of the
United States Military Telegraph Corps, and all were
eager to greet their former colleague.</p>

<p>Among those who were formed in line were the following:
James E. Pettit, C. Fred Loomis, Hamilton Young,
Ed P. Whitford, Thomas T. Eckert, Samuel Bruch, Jesse
H. Bunnell, W. K. Applebaugh, C. D. Hammond, J. C.
Van Duzer, Dennis Doren, Anson Stager, G. M. Brush,
Eli Cole, H. W. Cowan, J. E. Gamble, Patrick Mullarkey,
Douglass Kent, G. D. Sheldon and many others.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>&#8220;I would like to be among those to escort my young
friend to our Tabernacle,&#8221; remarked President Lincoln,
who could not think of Mr. Tinker in any other light than
being &#8220;young,&#8221; forgetting for the time being that he had
not seen the gentleman for more than a half century. But
time does not count in eternity. &#8220;I remember him so well,
and I used to be greatly pleased to call him and his
immediate colleagues &#8216;The Sacred Three.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See, what is that in the sky that looks like a comet?&#8221;
was asked on all sides. &#8220;If this is the Thunderbolt Express
it is twelve hours ahead of its record,&#8221; and everybody
hastened down to the spacious plaza where the big air
machine from Earth made her landing.</p>

<p>There was no screeching of whistles or ringing of bells,
or cries from the omnipresent hack and cabmen. Instead
of such distracting noises came the sound of many voices
in patriotic melody, and in the midst of tuneful airs of
&#8220;Hail Columbia&#8221; Charles A. Tinker was welcomed to a
temporary abiding place on the planet Mars.</p>

<p>The meeting between President Lincoln and his former
confidential operator was joyous, but not affecting, for
there is only joy in this haven.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Tinker locked arms for a stroll, for
both had much to talk about concerning past events. Mr.
Tinker verified many of the reports already inscribed on
the bulletin board and his patriotic words and spirit evoked
a tumult of applause.</p>

<p>The evening was given over to a social demonstration,
many of Mr. Tinker&#8217;s contemporaries and former employes
being in line to say some welcoming words to
their old friend.</p>

<p>A committee of Confederate telegraphers during the
Civil War, composed of George Ellsworth, David S. Ryan,
J. C. Hueston, C. C. Chute, Barney Hughes, David
Flanery, J. B. Tree, M. W. Barr, J. W. Kates and others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
came around to pay their respects to Mr. Tinker and all
distinctions and differences were forgotten.</p>

<p>General Grant, minus his once ever-present cigar, and
the noted Sherman brothers, William Tecumseh and John,
and many others of note, made an informal call on Mr.
Tinker and bid him welcome.</p>

<p>Fred B. Moxon, whom Mr. Tinker recognized as having
once been a page in the White House, shook hands with
the great cipher operator, Mr. Moxon presenting Mr.
Tinker with a deadhead pass over his telepathic wires to
Earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;This looks good to me,&#8221; said Mr. Tinker. &#8220;I only hope,
in using it, I will not be getting into trouble with the
Interstate Commerce Commission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never fear for that,&#8221; said Charlie Hammond, who
called to greet his old chieftain. &#8220;When you get rested
I will take you down the Mow Pack from St. Louis to
Houston, Tex., in my private car &#8216;Telegraph,&#8217; and I will
give you a life-long pass over the route, and lifetime here
means eternity, if you want to remain here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Tinker remarked, like St. Peter, that &#8220;It is good to
be here,&#8221; and the whole assemblage replied by a fervent
&#8220;Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>These little spheres are peopled by ex-inhabitants of
the Earth, who got tired of their long journey and desired
to tarry on the way.</p>

<p>Mr. Tinker recognized some faces in passing, but as he
was on a thorough express train he could not stop to
exchange greetings.</p>

<p>The day was spent in a patriotic manner, many eloquent
addresses being made by former statesmen and warriors,
and soul-inspiring melodies filled the air from all sides.</p>

<p>Truly, it was a never-to-be-forgotten day and even the
oldest inhabitant of this delightful place, Methusaleh by
name, voted it to be a red letter day in the history of the
planet Mars.</p>

TOM EDISON&#8217;S INVENTIONS APPLAUDED<br />
ON PLANET MARS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE is no way in which material things can be
smuggled into the sacred precincts of the planet
Mars. There is no gold, silver or paper money,
and nothing to buy, even if one possessed the
money, for there are no material pleasures or enjoyments
in this delightful spot.</p>

<p>Everyone is on a higher and more ennobling plane and
it is only the few who still thirst after the lusts of the
flesh who are rendered unhappy, but these are not quite
purged of their earthly desires.</p>

<p>It was announced upon the ever-ready bulletin board,
viz., the bright firmament of Mars, by the usual magic
touch of the wireless wand, that there would be an entertainment
given at the Telegraphers&#8217; Tabernacle, the chief
feature of which would be a phonographic concert, to be
followed by an exhibition of perfect Morse sending. There
would also be an exhibition of &#8220;ham&#8221; sending and a
rendition of a scene supposed to have taken place on &#8220;Old
No. 4 East&#8221; upon Mother Earth in the early &#8217;70s.</p>

<p>The records were made by George W. Conkling, the
past master of rapid transmission, who very recently
joined the Pleiades Club, and Secretary Moxon did not
inform his audience how he acquired the records, believing
his duties did not extend to giving out state secrets.</p>

<p>Many thousands gathered around to hear the music, and
it was certainly worthy to note that the clamor was for
the patriotic national anthems. When the &#8220;Star-Spangled
Banner&#8221; was rendered, everyone arose to his feet, many
so-called foreigners also, thus showing their respect and
admiration for the flag.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>This preliminary was the beginning of the real event of
the entertainment, and when the dots and dashes came
humming over the talking machine much enthusiasm
ensued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Puts me in mind of the time when I worked the Kansas
City duplex alongside of Ed. Foote, with Paul Bossert and
Jim Delong at the other end,&#8221; said James B. Coulter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it sounds like the way Adam Beidler used to try
and paste Emil Shape, on the first Milwaukee wire,&#8221;
ejaculated Harry McGill, who was an interested spectator
and listener.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really believe that this talking machine is the same
as the one we see illustrated in Telegraph and Telephone
Age, and which I was going to purchase just shortly before
I took my long flight,&#8221; remarked Wm. H. Magehan, of St.
Louis, a late arrival.</p>

<p>Selections from the talking machine were again in
order, and each individual stated his preference of pieces
to be played, and they were courteously taken care of.</p>

<p>Mike Tully asked to have &#8220;My Wild Irish Boy&#8221; played;
Charlie Newton designated &#8220;My Old Kentucky Home&#8221; as
his choice, and Lara C. Boone gave &#8220;St. Louis-Louis-Louis&#8221;
as his favorite, all of which were rendered in the highest
style of the art.</p>

<p>Joe Anderson, of Buffalo, would not be content until he
had listened to &#8220;John Anderson, My Jo-John,&#8221; and Billy
Thurman laughingly remarked that the occasion put him
in mind of the summer evenings in Oregon along in 1883.</p>

<p>Everybody voted the entertainment a big success and all
expressed a desire to have a repetition of the programme
very soon.</p>

<p>Timothy Collins, who was one of the &#8220;Great 8&#8221; in
Omaha, and who later became a guardian of the peace in
Buffalo, passed up the sun-kissed walk, whistling &#8220;A
Policeman&#8217;s Life is Not a Happy One,&#8221; and Court Cunningham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
suggested that record should be procured so Tim
could get the right swing to the air, which suggestion was
acceded to.</p>

<p>&#8220;These talking machines and the telegraph records beat
those old harps we used to hear talked of in the Bible,&#8221;
whispered Dick Tubman to his friend, Sam Cassidy, but
the latter scouted the remark, declaring that the music of
a jewsharp could not be excelled, and to verify his statement
Sam gave a demonstration of an artist playing the
jewsharp, which was received with applause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like criticizing your choice of music,&#8221; said
John Leatch, recently of San Francisco, &#8220;but you really
should turn back to the stirring melodies of California
when they sang &#8216;Empty is the Cradle, Baby&#8217;s Gone.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a chestnut John Leatch has plucked,&#8221; echoed
Captain James R. Dennis, as he smiled complacently at
his old-time colleague.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get your partners for Lancer&#8217;s quadrille,&#8221; came in
stentorian tones from the master of ceremonies pro tem,
A. R. Pippitt, and many ladies, once familiarly known to
the fraternity in Chicago, New York, St. Louis, Omaha,
San Francisco and other places throughout the United
States, joined hands with their brother operators and were
presently whirling on the green sward to the sweet strains
of Strauss&#8217; Blue Danube waltz, which followed the more
formal square dance.</p>

<p>The music was rendered by the miniature talking
machine which had been entertaining the company all
evening with songs, band melodies, telegraph records and
now came in to be used for dance music.</p>

<p>It was surely a lovely scene and everyone in the vast
assemblage had something nice to say about the great
wizard of modern times, who has added so much, not only
to the comfort of all mankind, but has found it practicable
to have every household possess an instrument of joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
forever, which will make life on the farm, the shepherd&#8217;s
hovel, the Indian camp fire, in fact, every place in this
vast world, more delightful by the music and delineations
reproduced by the modern talking machine.</p>

<p>It was ascertained from Secretary Moxon that the latest
advices from Mr. Edison showed he had retired to the top
of Pike&#8217;s Peak, to be alone with nature and to solve some
abstruse problems, and, understanding the vigils of the
great inventor, Hankus Cowanus, a knight errant of the
key, was detailed to signal the peak in hope of receiving
some intelligence from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; said Fred Moxon. &#8220;Your sending
never did carry from Chicago to Cincinnati, even in your
palmy days. Just leave it to me and you will have an
&#8216;extra&#8217; out next week which will tell you Mr. Edison
knows every desire of your little heart and he is going
about his Father&#8217;s business.&#8221;</p>

<p>The matter was allowed to rest there and we will get
more reports from these wonderful people later.</p>

DEBUT OF HENRY WARD BEECHER ON<br />
PLANET MARS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT WAS a bright, intelligent lot of men and women who
called upon Secretary Fred B. Moxon, on the planet
Mars, quite recently.</p>

<p>The spokesman, Ernest W. Emery, who had in his
possession half a year&#8217;s files of Telegraph and Telephone
Age, addressed Mr. Moxon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Ernest Emery Heard From</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;We are no kickers,&#8221; he began, &#8220;but Charles A. Tinker
just gave us all these late copies of the Age, and we notice
that among the records of the club, of which you are
secretary, you never vouchsafe a kind word for any of
the eastern boys or girls. There is nothing right about
this, and you must admit it. Our friends down there on
the Earth are as interested to hear from us, as are the
survivors in the Windy City or the dwellers on the
Nebraska prairies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right you are,&#8221; replied Mr. Moxon, &#8220;and I do not
think anyone is to be blamed for it. Washington is the
city where I was born and bred and it fills a deep place
in my heart, but the club is still young and my correspondent
is covering the ground systematically, and you
will all be heard from. Indeed, you will all have a
chapter in the very near future, and if you will give me a
little &#8216;dope&#8217; on some of our present members who are
bashful, I will get you all in excepting your photographs,
very soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter DeGraw, Ham. Young and Ernest Emery then
locked arms for a walk down the Rue for the purpose of
interviewing other old members of the guard from Washington
and procuring additional data.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, there&#8217;s Bob Bender, newly arrived and looking
as fresh as a clam. He was an attendant at the recent
reunion of the Old Timers&#8217; Association in New York and
ought to be full of good information. Let&#8217;s stop him and
get the news.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob Bender was delighted to greet his old friends again
and listened with much interest to the experiences of his
companions and, in turn, gave them the latest news from
Washington.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, George C. Maynard is there, looking as noble as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
ever, and Judd Thompson, C. F. Thompson, H. McKeldin,
John H. Miller and Dennis Brown are still in the harness.
Washington has gone dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bender went on to say that he had been over to
New York recently, but as there was going to be a New
York chapter in the Pleiades Club very soon, and also a
Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore number, he did not
care to spoil a good story by anticipating the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Bender locked arms with his comrades in their
interesting walk, and as they passed Aeolianville they
stopped to shake hands with William T. Loper, who was
being entertained by that most wonderful orator, Henry
Ward Beecher.</p>

<p>The quartette, composed of Messrs. Emery, DeGraw,
Bender and Young, stopped for a minute. They had
overheard some &#8220;shop talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Loper was saying, &#8220;you are the only fellow who
ever rushed me. Don&#8217;t you remember your sermon on
&#8216;Agreeing with your enemy,&#8217; and none of us could keep
up with you? I came nearly throwing up my job on that
very occasion.&#8221; It was stated for the benefit of those who
were not acquainted with the facts that each Sunday Mr.
Loper went from Washington to New York to copy Henry
Ward Beecher&#8217;s sermon. He then went to the telegraph
office at 195 Broadway, New York, and the sermons were
telegraphed from his note book to the principal papers in
the United States by Mr. Loper himself, who was one of
the finest operators as well as stenographers of his day,
and one of the few shorthand men who could copy Henry
Ward Beecher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, hi, 73,&#8221; came from the merry four and Loper smiled
all over, while Beecher asked what was meant by &#8220;73.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later in the day Fred Moxon interviewed his morning
visitor and made inquiries about the Cassidy boys, James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
P. and John S., and many other of his boyhood friends
still on Earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will have a Washington day very soon and we will
invite all of our old friends from near-by and I hope that
each city will get up a similar demonstration, as these
meetings are all for the good, and as the records of the
same will be printed in Telegraph and Telephone Age, it
will be a great comfort for our surviving friends to read of
the good times we are having up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was in the Washington office,&#8221; said Ham.
Young, &#8220;it gave me great pleasure to assist our boys
through their difficulties, and make their lives less burdensome,
and it now makes my heart feel good to see those
who have passed from Earth to Mars enjoying their well-earned
rest. The Washington boys all partake of the
nature of the &#8216;Father of his Country,&#8217; whom we have all
met in this ethereal mansion on various occasions, and are
proud to be identified with so distinguished a gentleman,
though we are all on a level here.&#8221;</p>


<h3><i>P. V. DeGraw Speaks</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;Washington is very different now to what it was years
ago when I used to rattle off the Associated Press news,&#8221;
chimed in Vory DeGraw. &#8220;We had no multiplexes and
page printers those days and each man was an artist at
the key. I have nothing but the happiest recollections of
my old telegraph friends in Washington, several of whom
have recently joined the throng in this abode of rest and
happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ernest Emery&#8217;s eyes sparkled with greater brilliancy
than ever as he heard the names of his old-time Washington
friends mentioned. &#8220;I hope that &#8216;Washington Day&#8217;
will be an event worthy of the great city and its associations,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Being the capital of the nation the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
men in the telegraph profession exist there, and those now
here will enter into the festivities of the occasion with the
greatest of pleasure, when their lives in that city are recalled
and rehearsed. All will have something pleasant to
relate.&#8221;</p>

THE MAGNETIC AND MORSE CLUBS<br />
ENTERTAIN</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MUCH activity was being displayed by the New
York members of the Pleiades Club on the fields
surrounding the Telegraphers&#8217; Tabernacle, and the
air reverberated with the sound of the hammer.</p>

<p>This activity was being manifest in the construction of
old-fashioned balloons, shambling dirigibles and the more
graceful aeroplane.</p>

<p>Of course it was really not necessary for the spirits on
the planet Mars to have any such slow means of locomotion
but the idea seemed to keep busy and active and be
entertaining to their friends.</p>

<p>The air craft was unique in appearance and novel in
design, and would have been considered marvelous on
Mother Earth.</p>

<p>Many hundreds of ex-New York telegraphers were on
the plaza, engaged in more serious conversation than was
generally their wont. The interest centered on the war
and the devastation being created by the U-boats.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the greatest confidence and hope in the ability
of Tom Edison to cope successfully with this menace,&#8221;
said Biff Cook, &#8220;just as he has mastered many another
difficult problem. I have no doubt that even now his keen
brain has invented a device to offset the machinations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the submarine. I don&#8217;t like to see our American boys
engaged in this strife and hope that Uncle Sam&#8217;s entrance
into the arena will have the moral effect of bringing on
the hoped-for peace,&#8221; and &#8220;Biff&#8221; sat down after prolonged
applause.</p>

<p>The New York Aeroplane Club invited their friends for
a whirl through space, their object being to try and meet
the &#8220;Thunderbolt Express,&#8221; which was expected hourly
bearing George W. Conkling.</p>

<p>Some hundred miles down the line, the &#8220;Thunderbolt
Express&#8221; was stopped and Mr. Conkling stepped aboard
the dirigible &#8220;Gotham&#8221; (Tom Ragen, commander), where
he was saluted by whistles laden with &#8220;73,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>Mr. Conkling was pleased with his reception and the
evening was spent in listening to the latest news from
Mother Earth as delivered by America&#8217;s fastest telegrapher.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is going to be a meeting of the Magnetic Club
tonight in the Telegraphers&#8217; Tabernacle and you are all
invited to come and have a good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker was John W. Mackay, and as his voice
rang out in hospitable notes, a tumult of applause broke
out on every side, which assured a full house.</p>

<p>The irrepressible John W. Kelly promised to be on hand
to entertain the gathering as &#8220;only Kelly can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Former telegraph presidents, general superintendents,
construction superintendents, linemen, managers, operators,
chiefs and wiremen all promised to take part in the
banquet which was destined to be a never-forgotten affair.</p>

<p>Music was the feature of the banquet and all the patriotic
pieces were played and encored to the echo.</p>

<p>J. W. Kelly was more than usually at home and his
songs and jokes kept the audience in a roar.</p>

<p>Addresses were made by the following gentlemen:
Belvidere Brooks, Alfred S. Brown, &#8220;Biff&#8221; Cook, Charlie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Parr, Tom Dolan, A. E. Sink, Jimmy Hennessey, Ed.
Delaney and others.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have had such a nice time this evening and we
have all been very much entertained,&#8221; said Belvidere
Brooks, &#8220;and as none of us are tired, supposing we take
an air flight in our machines by way of recreation, and
when we return the members of the Morse Club will be
very glad to have you tarry at our big round table and
partake of the Club&#8217;s hospitality.&#8221;</p>

<p>Events were occurring rather fast, but there was nobody
disinclined to have all the enjoyment there was in sight,
and after a joyful aerial ride, the Morse Club rooms began
filling up.</p>

<p>A diversion of programme was made and many ladies,
known to the profession, were present.</p>

<p>The speakers were: Alfred S. Downer and his brother
David, Gillie Olmstead, Henry A. Bogardus, Gib Merrill,
George Fagan, Hank Cowan and others.</p>

<p>Those present besides those mentioned were: William
Orton, Norvin Green, C. A. Tinker, E. D. L. Sweet, R. H.
Rochester, D. Rich, Stephen D. Field and his uncle Cyrus
W. Field, Moses G. Farmer, S. F. B. Morse, Alfred Vail,
Ed. Leslie, Fred N. Bassett, P. V. DeGraw, Ham. Young,
L. B. McCarthy, Dennis Doran, H. H. Ward, W. D.
Schram, J. W. Morlan, W. L. Waugh, Thomas T. Eckert,
Maurice Brick, D. B. Mitchell, Thomas P. Scully, J. A.
Henneberry, E. E. Stewart, James McParlan, H. V.
Shelley, M. H. Redding, Lant Jones, H. P. Dwight, J. C.
Hinchman, William J. Holmes and many others well
known on earth several years ago.</p>

OUR CANADIAN BROTHERS ON<br />
PLANET MARS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE FOLLOWING list of Canadian operators who
lived, flourished and passed away, either in this
country or in Canada, has been furnished by John
Fletcher, superintendent Canadian Pacific Railroad
Telegraph, with the suggestion that they be admitted into
the sacred precincts of the Pleiades Club. The list embraces
some well known and revered names:</p>

<p>Sam Garvey, Manager Dominion Telegraph Company,
Montreal, in the seventies; S. E. Gibbs, chief operator at
Toronto, Dominion Telegraph Company, in the seventies;
Jim Ingram, of Ogdensburg, N. Y., manager for a number
of years of the Montreal Telegraph Company there, succeeding
John Henderson in the early seventies; John

the District Telegraph Company at Montreal; Alexander
McNaughton, of the old Montreal Telegraph force in the
seventies and eighties; Larry Longmore of the same company
and of the same time; James Dakers, secretary of
the old Montreal Company, whose presence in the operating
room was a constant lesson in the virtue of economy;
Alexander Grant, superintendent of the Montreal Company,
a fine man and greatly respected; Thomas Elwood,
superintendent of the Dominion Telegraph Company at
Toronto, a fine operator and a man beloved by all who
knew him; P. Snyder, an old Dominion star and in later
life superintendent of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company&#8217;s
Telegraph at St. John, N. B.; Hiram Pingle, who
made his reputation at the House of Commons in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
seventies as a very fast sender, later superintendent of
the Canadian Pacific Railroad at Toronto; A. W. Barber
succeeded Pingle as superintendent at Toronto and he,
too, some years ago, went over to the silent majority;
Jonas Oliver, well known in western Canada around 1890
to 1905, a self-educated Icelander, fine operator (&#8220;Little
Skratti Icelandic&#8221; was his nickname); David J. Duff, one
of the best known of the younger generation of Canadian
operators, died 1905, at Winnipeg, aged twenty-eight; was

membership in the Pleiades Club; Orville A. Glenn, one
of Winnipeg&#8217;s best known stars, died 1911, aged thirty-seven
years. At time of his death he was a member of
the grain exchange and doing a lucrative brokerage business;
Joseph Quelch, a first class telegrapher and at one

RELIEF EXPEDITION FROM PLANET<br />
MARS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT HAD been decided by the members of the Pleiades
Club to send out a special train with attendants to
gather in any and all stray members found loitering,
so to speak, at the different wayside stopping places
between the Earth and Mars and bring them all into the
fold under the shadow of the Telegraphers&#8217; Tabernacle.
There were a number who did not respond to the roll call,
and while not believing that anything could be lost in
God&#8217;s great economic universe, still it was thought only
right to gather everybody in and have all in their
respective places.</p>

<p>Commodore R. R. Haines, who was a leader during his
sojourn on Earth, was appointed Captain of the expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and a delegation selected from every section of the
country and Canada were invited to accompany the
craft to identify all telegraph people eligible for membership
who were idling their time away among the many
stopping places on this long journey.</p>

<p>It had been resolved to begin at the moon and work
the way back, so Luna was the first satellite to be visited
and, lo and behold, Edward C. Cockey came to greet the
searching party.</p>

<p>Mr. Cockey was astonished to see his visitors and was
not at all loath to join them, the only regret he expressed
being that now the sentimental young ladies would have
no one to watch over them from the moon. He asked if
the &#8220;Man in the Moon&#8221; was still talked about on Earth
and was assured that he was. Aaron Hilliker sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;I&#8217;m in love with the man in the moon,</div>
<div class="verse">And I&#8217;m going to marry him soon,</div>
<div class="verse">And behind some dark cloud, where there&#8217;s no one allowed,</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;ll make love to the man in the moon.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;That settles it and I&#8217;m with you even if I must desert
my kingdom forever,&#8221; cried &#8220;Happy&#8221; Cockey, as he took
passage in Electric No. 1, bound for the outer regions.</p>

<p>The next stopping place will be &#8220;500,000-mile station,&#8221;
said Captain Haines, &#8220;and I believe we will find some
notable personage there.&#8221;</p>

<p>It took but one hour for Electric No. 1 to make the
journey to Skippityvous, as the retreat was named by
Tom Dushane, the only Frenchman aboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about that?&#8221; cried Ed. C. Keeler,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be jiggered if there isn&#8217;t Col. L. D. Parker, Charles
Thomas, Frank Kingsbury and Arthur W. Copp sitting out
there under a big oak tree playing a series of delightful
games.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Colonel L. D. Parker Remembers Friends</i></h3>

<p>Col. Parker expressed his satisfaction with his present
surroundings, but did not object to joining the merry
party, as he remembered the many happy days spent with
his comrades on Earth. Charlie Thomas, Arthur Copp and
Frank Kingsbury were ready to say goodbye to 500,000-mile
station when told of the doings on the planet Mars.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will stop off at Angel&#8217;s Camp and pick up Samuel
J. Kelley, who was with me in Los Angeles once upon a
time,&#8221; remarked Captain Haines, as they started out into
space.</p>

<p>It did not take many hours to reach Angel&#8217;s Camp,
where the whistles of their aeroplane tooted &#8220;73&#8221; to Sam
Kelley, which brought that brother to the front, accompanied
by Charles Stone.</p>

<p>The loiterers were taken aboard the car without much
ceremony, neither having to undergo that irksome task of
shaving and changing his clothes and both were delighted
to be in such excellent company, with the prospect of
meeting still more friends.</p>

<p>At Salt Creek, a surprise met the voyagers when it was
ascertained that Frank P. Medina would be on hand to
join the party. Medina had stopped off at Salt Creek
with his friend, Jack O&#8217;Brien, of San Francisco, and had
been having an enjoyable time, but was now ready to
climb higher toward the goal.</p>

<p>And so it kept up all day, the passengers regaling themselves
by merry songs and stories, in which Col. L. D.
Parker took a leading part.</p>

<p>The Colonel was anxious to hear the latest news from
Mother Earth and affectionately inquired after Edward
J. Nally, Edgar W. Collins, A. B. Richards, A. A. Briggs,
Thomas P. Wheeler, Harry A. Tuttle and many others,
all old co-workers, and he listened with much interest to
Arthur Copp&#8217;s history of each of these individuals.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>Many more stops were made en route back to the planet
Mars and many noted telegraph men were gathered into
the van, notably James Bell, of Nevada; John Henderson,
of Chicago; Ed. Sholes, Fred Benson, George and Joe
Harris, of St. Paul; Ruby Sheldon, of Cleveland; Charles
Catlin, Robert W. Chapman, George B. Simpson and
Charles D. Burke, of Chicago.</p>

<p>Many songs were sung, everyone joining in singing
&#8220;Where Is My Wandering Boy Tonight?&#8221; and &#8220;Hail! the
Conquering Hero Comes,&#8221; until the long journey was at
an end and they landed safely upon the planet Mars.</p>

<p>A big program of entertainment had been prepared to
welcome the loiterers to their new resting place and a
special bulletin of the two days&#8217; proceedings was prepared
by Secretary Fred B. Moxon to be transmitted to his
terrestrial partner, who would then disseminate the same
through the columns of Telegraph and Telephone Age to
all parts of the earthly globe.</p>


<h3><i>Exodus to Jupiter Contemplated</i></h3>

<p>A movement was now on foot to have an exodus from
Mars to Jupiter, and this proposition was being much
canvassed, particularly by the real old timers on Mars.</p>

<p>General George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Lord
Wellington, William Shakespeare, Christopher Columbus,
Americus Vespucius, Abraham Lincoln and many other
leaders while on Earth had manifested their disposition in
favor of making the trip, all realizing, however, that there
was no comeback.</p>

<p>&#8220;We understand,&#8221; said Ralph Waldo Emerson, &#8220;that
we are in God&#8217;s kingdom, and that we will be as safe up
there in Jupiter as we are right here on Mars, and the
thought of God&#8217;s omnipresence should remove doubt and
fear from every heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much interest but no anxiety was felt for the members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
who were determined to proceed, yet there were many
who desired to await the arrival of some particular dear
one from Earth and those decided they had &#8220;better bide-a-wee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Preparations for this hegira are now going on.</p>

PENNSYLVANIA DAY ON PLANET MARS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN MOST every western city in the United States there
exists a Pennsylvanian Society to which any genteel
person is eligible provided he or she hails from the
classic precincts of the Keystone State, the members
of the society evidently being of the opinion that &#8220;Once
a Pennsylvanian, always a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>The love of state is strong and it is beautiful to observe
the consideration shown to the denizens of the Smoky City
by the dwellers of the City of Brotherly Love, and also
to see how freely the former citizens of the oil region will
hob-nob with the residents of the more favored Harrisburg,
Stroudsburg and Erie.</p>

<p>Such is the condition of affairs on the terrestrial planet
during life and it is not to be wondered at that the feeling
would exist after the inhabitants of Pennsylvania had
taken a long flight to the planet Mars.</p>

<p>It was the latter part of the month of June, 1917, that
Jim McKinstry, Dan Francis and George W. Baxter, all
formerly of Erie; Mark Luce, Ed. M. Boynton, recently
from the oil section; Peter McKeever, from Pittsburgh,
and some of the former Philadelphia boys met and talked
over the proposition of having a good old-fashioned Fourth
of July celebration on the occasion of the next Independence
Day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>A number of gentlemen dropped in on the meeting from
Pennsylvania, many of whom had acquired national fame
and whose names are household words still on earth.</p>

<p>Telegraphers&#8217; Tabernacle, on the planet Mars, was to
be the place where the happy event was to take place and
the usual bulletin written by a wireless wand on heaven&#8217;s
bright empyrean gave notice to all of the coming event.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how these Pennsylvanians would like to have
a visit from the Chicago delegation,&#8221; ejaculated Ed. Whitford,
&#8220;we have quite a formidable crowd to introduce.&#8221;</p>

<p>A cordial invitation was extended the Chicago delegation
and any other members of the craft who wanted to
come, and preparations for the entertainment were immediately
begun.</p>

<p>Wednesday, July 4, 1917, arrived and the grounds
around Telegraphers&#8217; Tabernacle, on the planet Mars, were
the scene of much merriment, the badges of the Keystone
State being in evidence everywhere.</p>

<p>It was not what the people on Mother Earth would term
a &#8220;sane&#8221; Fourth, as there was a big display of firecrackers
and the like, the wish having been expressed that the
occasion would be one of the &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; kind. Conditions
were changed from those on the terrestrial planet,
there being nothing of a combustible or inflammatory
character on Mars which might invite a conflagration.</p>

<p>A brass band was heard in the distance playing that old
song, &#8220;We are Coming, Father Abraham, Six Hundred
Thousand More,&#8221; and immediately automobiles containing
the Chicago delegation began to arrive.</p>

<p>Among them were the following: Frank M. and Newt
Crittendon, Wm. Foley, N. L. Boydston, C. H. Kelly, J. E.
Zeublin, A. C. Thomas, John Boughan, P. A. Rowe, Fred
Swain, W. W. Wells, J. C. Delong, A. J. Long, John D.
Walker, T. P. Dudley, F. S. Kent, S. O. Bracken, Wm.
Wallace, Jr., Al Baker, W. C. Ramsdell, Col. J. J. S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Wilson, W. Chapman, S. C. Mason, J. C. Springer, M. C.
Bristol, C. H. Summers, G. W. Fulton, Francis W. Jones,
H. C. Maynard, E. S. Patton, W. A. Leary, John A. Strong,
Luke Fisher, H. G. McGill, Billy McMillen, C. M. Roebuck,
Henry Tatge, J. DeWitt Congdon, Harry S. Converse,
Frank W. Farley, Jeff Prentice, Earl Rudd, C. H. Haskins,
C. W. Gearhart and many others, including a large sprinkling
of ladies.</p>

<p>Good natured chaffing was carried on, Charlie Roebuck
being asked what was done with that undistributed $300,000,000
his firm had in reserve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we bought Liberty Bonds with that money,&#8221; came
the immediate and patriotic reply.</p>

<p>Among other pieces played by the bands were, &#8220;We&#8217;ll
Rally Round the Flag, Boys, We&#8217;ll Rally Once Again&#8221;;
&#8220;Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, the Boys are Marching&#8221;; &#8220;Columbia,
the Gem of the Ocean&#8221;; &#8220;America&#8221;; &#8220;Dixie Land,&#8221;
and such darky songs as &#8220;Darkies, Have You Seen the
Massa, with the Moustache on His Face, Walking Down
the Road this Morning, Like He&#8217;s Gwine to Leeb the
Place?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Tabernacle was visited during the day by Generals
Grant, Sherman, McClellan, Sheridan, Franz Siegel, G. H.
Thomas, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and many
others, including all the Presidents back to George Washington&#8217;s
time.</p>

<p>Songs were sung, speeches made, music indulged in
and a most enjoyable and entertaining program was given.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia and Pittsburgh committees were
unremitting in their efforts and the Fourth of July, 1917,
passed into history on the planet Mars with pleasant
memories and a strong feeling of meeting again and often.</p>

THE JOURNEY TO JUPITER</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was no great preparation among the whilom
dwellers on the planet Mars for their exodus to the
planet Jupiter, and the long journey was to be
taken without any formality.</p>

<p>Professor Samuel F. B. Morse early indicated his
willingness to join the moving multitude and his decision
was hailed with delight. Professor Morse was in close
conversation with Fred Moxon for several hours prior to
the departure.</p>

<p>Mr. Moxon had disclosed to Professor Morse his <i>modus
operandi</i> of communication with Mother Earth and similar
methods were arranged to obtain signals from Jupiter
after the arrival of the newcomers on the planet.</p>

<p>It was an unknown and untried field which they were
to invade, but, realizing that God was present everywhere,
there was no fear in the spirit of the vast throng.</p>

<p>Goodbyes were heard on every side, but there was no
sorrow expressed and nothing occurred to mar the serenity
and tranquillity of either the travelers or those who
remained. It was akin to the experience of passing through
the belief of death on earth, for there was no coming back,
but onward, upward to God&#8217;s immortal realm.</p>

<p>The firmament of the planet Mars was interestedly but
not anxiously scanned all day for some intelligence from
the exodus party, and toward evening of the same day
they were rewarded by a flash on the sky, written by
wireless pen in the unmistakable chirography of Fred B.
Moxon. The message read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Greetings from New Providence, Jupiter. God hath
wrought wonders and wonderful are His works. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
arrived in high spirits, happy, and will give more particulars
later.</p>

<p class="right">
&#8220;Signed, S. F. B. Morse.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>

<p>The message occasioned much joy and satisfaction and
further news was looked for.</p>

<p>A few hours later the wireless wand began moving
again, inditing a long message from Professor Morse as
follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! We have just had
a visit from Adam and Eve. We have also met Noah,
Abraham, Moses, David and Solomon, and this evening
we are to have a gathering of the entire family now residing
on the planet Jupiter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I find the Bible is historically correct as regards the
names and doings of the incidents recorded, and everything
is very interesting and absorbing to us. We have learned
much already, but there is still a great deal more to learn
and to prove.&#8221;</p>

<p>A cry of joy went up from the readers of the message
from Professor Morse, many remembering how his first
message, &#8220;What hath God wrought?&#8221; had broken the
fetters of time and annihilated space, and now comes a
second message to break the shackles of human belief.</p>

<p>All day and evening messages were exchanged between
the planets Mars and Jupiter, nothing undergoing censorship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bogy&#8221; got in the first deadhead message to the Earth.
It was addressed to John B. Taltavall, publisher Telegraph
and Telephone Age, and announced his safe arrival on the
planet Jupiter. He did not neglect sending &#8220;73&#8221; to all
of his friends on Earth.</p>


<h3><i>Adam Sends &#8220;73&#8221; to His Posterity</i></h3>

<p>Adam sent a message to his children, grandchildren <i>ad
infinitum</i>. He was at a loss what to say to the posterity
on Earth, as his legacy to them was a chapter of misery,
but &#8220;Bogy,&#8221; with his usual effrontery and nonchalance,
remarked, &#8220;Why Grandpa Adam, just do as I did&mdash;send
them all your &#8216;73&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;which was done amid wild applause.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>Noah, who was the first shipbuilder we know anything
about, was greatly interested in listening to Homer Hallock
relate of the era of shipbuilding on Earth.</p>

<p>Methusaleh smiled a trifle loftily when Jerry Newton
told about the Texas woman who still lives at 130 years.
&#8220;She is not my class at all,&#8221; ejaculated Methusaleh; &#8220;she
belongs to Esau and Jacob and the younger generation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Intense interest was manifested when Adam took the
floor during the evening for a little talk.</p>

<p>The newcomers are objects of much interest to the old
sojourners on Jupiter, there having been no accessions
from the Earth or Mars for as much as a thousand years,
as nearly as anyone could reckon time, there being no
established manner of computing the years.</p>

<p>Mark Twain, America&#8217;s great humorist, was with the
new arrivals from Mars and, true to his colors, facetiously
asked Nero if he would not play the Sailors&#8217; Hornpipe on
his fiddle, so all could have a dance, and wonderful to
relate, Nero produced the instrument and graciously played
the piece.</p>

<p>The last seen of Twain was down at the levee, where
he found Samson, the strong man, to whom he related
the doings of the latter day gladiators.</p>

<p>Later in the day Professor Morse read a communication
from Mother Earth filled with good news from the great
war, and there was much rejoicing, even Nebuchadnezzar
and Confucius, China&#8217;s greatest philosopher, showing their
interest.</p>

<p>Franklin L. Pope discovered that the telephone was
known and worked by the denizens of Jupiter in prehistoric
days and it was developed by Charles A. Tinker that
the quadruplex was worked more than ten thousand years
ago. These facts, however, should not take any lustre
from the endearing names of Morse, Edison, Vail and
others, who rediscovered both of these wonderful accessories
to human convenience and gave them to the world.</p>

<p>More of these wonderful doings will be told in subsequent
editions of this book.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
